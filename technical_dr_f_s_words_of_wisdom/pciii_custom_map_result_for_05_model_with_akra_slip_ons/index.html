I think a lot of people mirror this sentiment. I've experienced the snatchy throttle and had some weird experiences with the KTM maps .. i had a service done a year or so ago where they put on a new Akra map .. the bike was unbelievable as i rode it away from the dealer.. so smooth.. very little backfire .. it felt perfect.. then as the weeks ticked by it became more and more like it was before .. till it ended up being very grumpy down low and not a great pleasure to ride. <br> <br>Anyway .. with KTM having killed the resale of 05/06 SD's in Oz there is no way i would consider selling her so i set about fixing her. I read all the opinions of adding the PCIII and it sounded like most if not all were happy once the custom map had been done. <br> <br>I installed the PCIII and loaded the map for the "Advanced map with Akra slip ons and O2 eliminators fitted" .. standard air filter by the way. <br> <br>I felt the bike was "better" but still not great.. still running to rich i felt. So off to the dyno it went. <br> <br>The results were pretty staggering.. I had two custom maps done .. one for baffles in and one for baffles out.. Sometimes i need the bike to be quieter for early starts and the odd track day where they are being "childish" about noise restrictions.. I was also curious to see what the difference would be... <br> <br>The dyno tech basically ran the bike as I gave it to him and didn;t even try to modify the PC map loaded .. said it was so far out it was better to start from scratch. I was thinking later, how could this map be so far out .. but when you consider the map was done likely on a US model with different fuel and climatic conditions (altitude, temp, etc..) it probably makes sense. <br> <br>Anyway .. have a look at the graphs below .. the total HP/Torque numbers aren't in the WOW zone but as we all know, dyno to dyno comparisons are not accurate.. the main thing to look at here are the gains made from the PC standard download map to the custom map for both baffles in and out. <br> <br>HP Curve... <br> <br>RED is how I gave it to them .. <br>BLUE is after re-map with OPEN pipes .. <br>GREEN is after re-map with removable baffles inserted .. <br> <br>Not much difference between OPEN and BAFFLES after remap but the OPEN pipes do make a bit more power right at the bottom.. so OPEN it is but nice to have the option of BAFFLES in when I need to. <br> <br><img src="http://i528.photobucket.com/albums/dd327/Bretski72/SD-DYNO-HPCurve.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>TORQUE Curve... <br> <br>RED is original.. <br>GREEN is after re-map with OPEN pipes .. <br>BLUE after re-map with baffles inserted.. <br> <br>Again more torque right off the bottom without the baffles .. but not a huge difference after that.. but from what it was both are sensational. <br> <br><img src="http://i528.photobucket.com/albums/dd327/Bretski72/SD-DYNO-TORQUECurve.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>Seat of the pants is obviously the real test though.. all I can say is .. its all LOVE baby. Feels like they bolted another cylinder to her.. The result is more than I expected and the bike is VERY smooth and pulls like a train. <br> <br>I know plenty of people have said we shouldn;t have to add a PCIII and pipes etc.. to have a bike that runs right.. I agree somewhat for those that want to keep a stock bike .. it should work well from the factory.. but i can't remember the last bike i owned that didn;t get pipes.. which generally means you need to re-map or re-jet to get the best out of them .. in the end if the only thing making you unhappy with the SD is the fuelling.. then I'd recommend the PCIII and remap .. you'll loose a lot more money trying to sell it and replace it with something .. well .. boring in comparison !</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=weeksy" alt=weeksy> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">weeksy</h3> <time datetime="2008-08-05 13:30:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2008-08-05 13:30:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Nice graphs... but damn that's a big dip in the middle of the torque graphs</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=sdrk" alt=sdrk> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">sdrk</h3> <time datetime="2008-08-05 13:35:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2008-08-05 13:35:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>yeah.. agree.. you can see the slight dip in power at the same RPM in the HP graph as well ..
