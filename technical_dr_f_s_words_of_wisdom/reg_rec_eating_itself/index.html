If you need a cure for insomnia, read on.....<br><br><br><br>So I might be jumping the gun a bit and asking a leading question but I'm willing to follow up on alternative ideas/suggestions. I've been through the site looking at the topics on batteries, reg/rec failure, soft/dat messages and alternators and I think my reg/rec is failing. I suspect that the battery might now be a bit marginal (see below) but I don't want to replace it if the real problem is the reg/rec which is just going to wreck the next battery.<br><br><br>Over the last 600 – 700 miles (incl track time), I've had the following – but none of them consistently:<br><br>sluggish starting<br>5000 rpm on the clocks but normal real tick-over – went away next start, not repeated<br>fast flashing indicators - sometimes<br>battery light (low voltage) coming on –2 or 3 times, goes away shortly after<br>clock resets to 12:00<br><br>When I've charged the battery it starts fine – and I've been having the above issues when running with the headlight fuse removed as well as with the lights on.<br><br>I've visually inspected the wiring that I can see (after cleaning all the crap off from all the wiring in/on/around the battery box) and checked behind the headlight mask and all of the fuses and everything looks OK – no signs of wear/melting/scorching etc. and all the connectors, despite being covered in crap, have all cleaned up OK and look fine.<br><br>I've got a rubbish multi-meter (to the nearest volt, no decimals) and have got the following results:<br><br>Battery – straight after charging:<br><br>11/12 V, bike not running, ignition off<br>11 V, bike not running, ignition on, lights on<br>12/13 V, bike running, lights on – revving the bike doesn't appears to have any consistent effect but the voltage fluctuates around 12/13V<br>(when hitting the starter, the voltage drops to 8/9V for a split second at least once – I've only tried this a couple of times so I don't know if it happens all the time)<br><br>I've struggled with the Service Manual instructions but I think I've managed to test the generator coils (I'm assuming they mean the alternator – difference in terminology). The big, flat brown connector with the three yellow wires that sits next to the battery box cover is what I've tested. Disconnected it, tested the socket that goes to the alternator (as opposed to the reg/rec) for resistance. The multimeter beeps and gives pretty much the same reading for any pair of the 3 possible combinations of the 3 connectors in the block. This appears to be in line with what is expected – low resistance (beeps below 30 Ohms), no short, all combinations reading the same.<br><br>I thing I understand the section about checking for loss of current – but the multimeter I have only appears to be fable to check AC current.<br><br>The bike is bog standard '07 with a battery tender lead fitted and I've got a lead fitted for a heated vest – but haven't used it recently. I've been fairly careful with it so it is only on when out of town. I know these can ruin batteries.<br><br>So, thoughts please and has anyone tried the MOSFET reg/rec that has been mentioned on here – they only appear to be available from the US and look like they need some work to make them fit?<br><br>Are there other alternatives apart from the KTM version - which I'm assuming will eat itself eventually? <br><br>The KTM version appears to have been replaced with a different model number – is it actually any better/different?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/No47.svg" alt="No. 47"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">No. 47</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-24 18:15:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hey bro...<br>I haven't had any real problems...I thought I did but it was <br>my own dumb actions that caused it..Culprit actually WAS the battery..<br>Mine went bad and only had 1,000miles on the clock..<br>Didn't have a tendor..<br>It's a good idea to keep it on one...I got one right after spending $200<br>for a new battery...<br>Several guys have gone to Mosfet regulators..<br>Aside of the KTM regs being hard to get...<br>They are the reg of choice for other bikes too...<br>A guy I know rides a Buell 1125 and had his OEM reg replaced twice<br>within 5,000 miles..Bought it new...<br>Got a used Mosfet and was for a different bike even...<br>wired it up and hasn't had a problem since...<br>Hope it helps...<br>Search it on this site...<br>It's there...<br> </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-24 19:16:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Based on my experience, replace both the battery and reg/rec - you could replace one at a time but you will need to replace both sooner or later and if it is only one and not the other, you will have the spare ready when you need it.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/No47.svg" alt="No. 47"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">No. 47</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-24 19:53:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Somehow mines made it to 50k without it going.

The coils on the generator seem fine and also they almost never crap out unless you have something comming loose and eats it.<br>Charge the battery properly and do the tests again. Also get your battery tested by a place who have a load tester, most places who sell batteries or garages have them.
