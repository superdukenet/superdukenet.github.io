My last bike was a 09 GSXR 750. I ran BT016s and Power Ones on that bike and really never had an handling problems with the bike. Steering was quite neutral and the front was always hooked up. If I tried hard, I could spin up the rear, but it was always intended and predictable.<br><br>Then I test rode a SD. For those So Cal denizens, I took my test ride on Decker Canyon from Westlake to to the top of the hill and back. For those who are unfamiliar with this road, you couldn't have a better test platform for the SD, IMO. Tight turns, fast chicanes, banked turns - its a Sumo paradise. I was sold. The SD was far easier to ride up up that road than the GSXR. I could basically put it anywhere in the lane that I wanted and it transitioned from side to side with amazing agility - just like a SD should. And I never had any question about what the front tyre was doing.<br><br>Within a year, I bought my SD. At first, it handled like a pig. It wouldn't turn. It ran wide. It wanted to stand up in the middle of a turn. The suspension was all fooked up. I got the suspension tuned and all was good again.<br><br>Then I replaced the stock Corsa IIIs with aftermarket Corsa IIIs and lost that lovin' feeling - especially in the cold. I switched to M5s and things got worse. On any given day, I could not feel the front. The only time I had any feel was on really warm days. Otherwise, it was numb. <br><br>I switched to Q2s and they are better. But, I still don't have the confidence and control I had with the original Q2s. (Oh, and when I changed to the M5s, I switched to Forged rims, so they are 2-3lbs lighter.<br><br>So, here's what I've been researching - tyre diameters:<br><br>Corsa III F: 601mm R: 639mm<br>M5 F: 600mm R: 630mm<br>Racetec F: 600mm R: 641mm<br>Q2 F: 604mm R: 634mm<br>BT016 F: 601mm R: 629mm<br>Power One F: 611mm R: 630-644mm (this was the only tyre to give min and max diameters)<br>Power 2CT F: 602mm R: 627mm<br>Pwr Pure F: 600mm R: 630mm<br><br>So, I ass u me, that KTM tuned the SD suspension for the Corsa IIIs. Now, I have no idea whether the OEM Corsa IIIs correspond to the data I found, but for sake of argument, lets assume that they do. Will dropping the rear 4.5mm (Corsa III versus M5) dramatically affect the front end feel? If so, would dropping the front a couple of <br><br>I've noticed that a lot of Brits swear by the Ractecs for track days and its interesting to note that the Racetec rear is closest in diameter to the Corsa III than all the others. The rear Q2 is closest in diameter to the Corsa III and it has given me the best performance besides the Corsa III. <br><br>Am I on to something here, or just FOS?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/JohnJJr.svg" alt=JohnJJr> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">JohnJJr</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-02-07 05:14:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I'm runnin Q2's and not complaining at all.

I'd do that after setting rider sag up first. You've got lighter rims on your bike ( wish i had those ) <br>i hear they make a world of difference. So pushing tubes into triples for you shouldn't feel like you're slowing up the turn in - i sure don't feel like mines slow and i have stock rims. <br><br>other than that - that's about as far as what i know can help you with.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ktmguy.svg" alt=ktmguy> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">ktmguy</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-02-07 11:06:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Regarding not turning in.

But then, I assume you know this by now.<br><br>Never been a fan of BT-016s; either the OEM variants (as were on your 750), or the standard ones. Worst feedback/feel of any of the tyres you list IMO.<br><br>PowerPures and PowerOne "Commercial" (the street tyres) also suck. They suck on the street, and are a complete waste of money on track.<br><br>Pilot Power 2CTs, I keep coming back to. May try some Q2s next go-round.<br><br>I think all of you overlook an important factor regarding suspension effects from tyres: "squish" of the tyre (and when loaded with rider, temperature and pressure effects, rotation speed, slip, etc.). As these tyres are not constructed identically, they do not deform/deflect equally. Translation: Using circumferential data to determine trail (or other geometry and suspension effects) isn't necessarily going to give you what you think it will on paper. Then, just to inject more (and real) complexity to this, is how any given tyre behaves as a <span style="font-style: italic">part</span> of the suspension. Yes, that's right, a tyre has spring, compression, and rebound qualities; additional artifacts that affect things like "feedback" and "feel". And, if you're not totally bored with this yet, these qualities will change as a function of temperature, pressures (somewhat a function of temperature also), and tyre condition (age, wear, and how/where its worn).<br><br>Dude - did you try lowering some tyre pressure - especially up front? Couple PSI at a time ... Do you know how filled your forks are? Did you try removing any oil?
