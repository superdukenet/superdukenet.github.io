(Not sure if this is good enough for the 'How to do it' section.) <br> <br>(Before I forget, thanks to those who contributed to the idea, Ohlins and Madden.) <br> <br>Before you start: <br>- you will need a 2007-onwards fuel tank. And the spoilers. I sourced these off ebay UK and Germany respectively. <br> <br>- Inner cover spoiler left 07: 61108050050 £7.42 <br>- Inner cover spoiler right 07: 61108051050 £7.42 <br>- Fuel Hose 05: 61007016000 £12.82 - useful to get this as it has a manufactured 90-degree bend in it <br>- 2x Variable One-Ear Clamp 15.3mm: 00050153706 £1.44each <br>- O-Ring set for Fuel Pump 05: 61007089000 £30.30 <span style="font-weight: bold">!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span> - that isn't a typo. I'd damaged mine taking the pump out in a bit of a hurry. Slow down and save £30. <br>- you will need some patience, especially as the parts took two weeks to arrive from KTM!! <br> <br> <br>Remove the seat, side panels from your current 2005-06 SuperDuke. <br> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1187.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>Prop the tank up on it's hydraulic stand. Remove the bung at the top of the tank. <br> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1195.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>There are two wiring clips that need to be unplugged from the tank. They are the bottom two in the picture. Worth undoing the top one anyway for later on. <br> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1188.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>From the left hand side of the tank, see that vertical pipe that runs to the bottom of the fuel pump. That's the fuel line. If you follow that down there is a quick-release system on that line that you need to press a stud in to seperate. It's a bugger to get to though. Be patient. <br> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1194.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>Now, siphon any remaining fuel out of the tank into a suitable container. Any fuel left over will probably cover your floor when you take the fuel-pump out. <br> <br>Once you've removed all of the fuel you can, go ahead and remove the tank entirely from the frame. Note the orientation of the pump in the tank in case you abort the next steps and want to put everything back together. <br> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1201.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>Grab your fuel container. Undo the 4x bolts that hold the fuel pump into the bottom of the tank. Slowly prise the fuel pump out of it's resting place. On my tank it took some effort before it loosened itself. But try and hold it straight at all times. There are two O-rings around the fuel pump, one right at the base, and one a fraction higher. Gently prise off the upper o-ring and put to one side. You may want to play around with fitting/moving the fuel pump and tank around on the bike to check my instructions - removing the o-ring makes fitting/removing the pump multiple times easier. <br> <br>At this point any remaining fuel in the tank can be easily poured into your fuel container. <br> <br>At this stage we should now have the old tank fully removed from the bike, and the fuel pump removed from it. Go ahead and remove the hydraulic stand and rubber bungs from this tank. Refit the rubber bungs to the new one at this time, to save hassle later. <br> <br>Orientate the fuel pump with the new tank as shown below (180degrees from the original position). Insert a couple of the fuel pump bolts that you removed earlier, just to hold it in position whilst you work out the next bit. <br> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1217.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>Position the tank in it's normal place on the bike, and you can see that the fuel hose now runs out the back of the tank, and generally the pump is fouling on the electrics. It's also a tight fit underneath the tank, especially when you lift the tank up on it's stand. <br> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1206.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>To solve this I decided the reroute the fuel line, and re-position the electrics. It saved over 300GBP on a smaller (less tall) 2007 fuel pump, so worth investing some time in as it can all be put back to the original state later. First the electrics. <br> <br>This is what it looked like before. <br> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1203.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>I figured that directly under where the rider sat there is quite a bit of space, so I could move the electrics up and backwards in the undertray to create some space around the fuel pump area. <br> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1211.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>And below is one of the same area after some slight modifications. I played around with various layouts, eventually got bored and settled on this. If you find a better orientation let me know. Please! <br> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1216.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br> <br>I used some strips of flexible metal from hardware store, bent them into shape, screwed them into where the relays were originally mounted, then mounted the relay plate to it. The fuse box simply slips underneath, leaving plenty of room around the fuel pump. Note: I seperated the two wires that run to the tank from the cable-tied bundle that KTM created. This gives a little more extension on the cables to make the fuse box slide easily towards the rear of the bike. It's snug enough under there it doesn't need any special mounting points, yet is easily accessible in an emergency. Again, if you find a better solution... <br> <br>Now the tank and pump will fit with little bother. Just the routing of the fuel line to go. I've used a clear tube in the pictures to show the routing of where I will put the final hose. Hopefully it's visible in the pics. I've used a hose which is much thicker in diameter than the final fuel hose, so it will bend a little easier and not protrude as much.&lt;p&gt; <br>First picture shows where the hose will pop out from under the tank on the left-hand-side and curve around to the fuel pump connection. <br> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1215.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>Second picture below you can just about make out how the tube runs across the top of the frame and joins the quick-release connector, which is visible inside the triangle or 'V' formed out of the frame where the cable tie is visible. <br> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1214.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>Back at the ranch. We need to remove the old fuel hose from the fuel pump and quick-release system. Easy enough to cut this off at both ends, so no pictures of that. Put the new hose in place. You'll see that the 90degree bend in the hose comes in handy to make the curve of the hose really simple. Crimp one end securely onto the fuel pump projection using the new clips bought for the job (if you bothered). Do the same for the other end, this time obviously attaching the quick-connect system. <br> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1226.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>Insert the two new O-rings onto the fuel pump, again if you'd bothered getting new ones. Or just put back the originals if you didn't. Insert fuel pump (using correct orintation) into the tank, and secure in place using the 4x bolts. <br> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1222.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>The tank should now be ready for final installation. Position the tank into place, ensuring fuel line is routed as shown and that all wires are easily accessible. Insert the bolts into the side of the tank mounts and secure. Re-connect all of the remaining wires to/from the tank, and any others you've unclipped during any of the previous steps. <br> <br>The rest is a quick fit of all the bits you've taken off. The hard work is all done. <br> <br>- Swap the fuel cap from the old tank to the new one. <br>- Install the hydraulic arm lift to the side of the tank. <br>- Install the bung into the top of the tank, so you can secure the tank back into place on the frame when in it's lowered position. Lower tank, but don't secure yet in case you need to lift it again. I had to fiddle with cutting the rubber bung so it would fit properly. <br>- Put a litre or two of fuel into the tank. Turn on the ignition and start it up. <br>- Check all connections are secure, that you don't have fuel leaking out anywhere. <br>- Lift the tank, with the engine still running. Look underneath the tank and make sure no wires are being fouled, or the fuel line crushed. <br>- If all OK, lower fuel tank, secure with the mounting bolt, fill with fuel and go do 120+ miles before filling up again!! <br> <br>Finished article: <br> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1227.jpg" alt=Image> <br><img src="http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p383/superdukegod/KTM/IMG_1228.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>So, that's saved me over £3000 upgrading to either a newer SD, or to a brand spanking SMT. Money/time well spent if you ask me.

As it turns out, the fuel hose mentioned is no longer produced but is replaced by the following item 61007116050. According to the description it already has a fast connector added to at least one side. The problem is, I don't know if that thing would fit, any ideas ?<br>The other thing my dealer mentioned, you would need a special tool to close those clips that secure the hose. I guess I could take the pump with the hose and clip to my dealer to close it up, but do you really need a special tool or would a normal pliers work as well ?<br>In case the new hose would not fit due to whatever reason, can anyone tell me the diameter of the hose ? I would then check if I can get one from someplace else, aparently my dealer can only order by number, not just "give me 20" of fuel hose" ....<br>Thank you very much for your help </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Mackie.svg" alt=Mackie> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Mackie</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-07-09 10:08:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>This stuff is gold!<br>Tank range on my 05 Superduke is laughable.

The threaded holes you don't need to worry about as they are not all the way through to the inside of the petrol tank, but you must block off the big one. Right size O-ring and some metal plate should do the job, or you can search for second hand fuel gauge for SD 2007+<br>Hope that helps,<br>It's well wort the conversion, as now I have around 50% extra miles out of the tank.
