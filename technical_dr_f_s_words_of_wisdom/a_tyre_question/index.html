We have such roads in the Snowy Mountains of NSW 'Sydney'. They are sharp gravel layed in tar, and are seldom used by traffic. They tear apart tyres in half the time; my R1 208's barely lasted 2000kms (about 1600miles). If this is not the case I have no idea. <br> <br>Hope others can help. <br> <br>Greg</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/9nine0.svg" alt=9nine0> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">9nine0</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2007-12-27 12:33:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I doubt the tyres are faulty or the tyre pressure wrong as Joe checks every other day by the sound of it.

The triple-compound rear is supposed to be soft on the shoulders &amp; firm in the middle, to compensate for the amount of time that a bike is upright vs. turning. Personally, I always buy the stickiest DOT tyre (Metzeler M3 or the old Rennsport RS1) and a sticky Sport Touring or Sport tyre on the back. This way, when it's time to change the back, the front is equally trashed. 98% of roads in Texas are like yours - flat, straight, boring - trails to the minimal twisty bits. <br> <br>tyre tyre tyre <br> <br>BASTARDS! I spell the word for the rubber hoops on my wheels T - I - R - E, not TYRE. Auto spelling indeed!!!

I do not, I throw caution into the wind cos I like fun, just like I like bikes, If you were one of my riding mates and we pulled over to the side of the road, and you asked me.....joe,,, would you trade this $100,00 bill for all of those corners back behind and in front of us today,,,,as to save your tyres for another day, I would say no, hell no. so I feel like this is the price that I pay to play. If I did have premature wear and tear, the way folks are here where I am located,,,, they would larph at me and say get the hell outta here you jack ass ....joe!! These are dot racing tyres as far as I am concerned, their is no life expectancy warranty. the way I am is.....if you don't like the service do not go back, even if you bitch about something that is just a better reason to give you shit service if you do ever come back.

Ditto on the dealer thing too: I usually travel &gt;20miles to shops when there are many within 3miles of my place - just for service and product quality and price. <br> <br>I am thinking the same as you on this one.. they are race tyres and that is how they last. I ran Pilot Race tyres for a few thousand miles and loved them even though they had a short lifespan on the road. <br> <br>If anyone read or have 1st or 2nd hand experience with the Corsa's it would be great to hear. I also have a vested interest with these tyres; as they have been recommended by a friend and they are/were planned to be my next ride - depending on feedback.</div></p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
