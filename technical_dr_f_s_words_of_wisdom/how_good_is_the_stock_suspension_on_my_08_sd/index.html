The exception to this is if their 'old' suspension was basically worn out, then I'd expect them to notice the change.

If you can get both sag settings right you won't need a new spring. once you have this done make sure the compression/rebound settings are on the std settings, the rear has hi and low speed damping remember. RIDE IT! TRY IT, on the road, preferably a piece of road you know, a few times, think about how the bike rides, feels turns etc. setting the sag correctly is the base line for all suspension settings, if you can't get these right you're wasting your time and money doing anything else, correct sag also offers the biggest cheapest improvement for regular riders. from there you can adjust the compression and rebound depending on how the bike behaves, small increments, keep notes and try it if it's better keep going in small increments if it's worse put it back. there's plenty of places you can find instructions on what does what and how each function and adjustment will affect how the bike rides, and it's a great way to learn more about your bike and what you like which will translate to easier set up in future.<br><br>paul</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/tripoddave.svg" alt=tripoddave> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">tripoddave</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-02-22 12:45:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Crotchrockety.svg" alt=Crotchrockety> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Crotchrockety</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-02-22 16:15:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/loony888.svg" alt=loony888> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">loony888</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-02-22 17:31:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>To get back to the original question: the stock suspension is very very good.<br>use the user manual to set it to the recommended track settings and enjoy.<br>200lb will just ensure the ride is a little more plush.<br>Modding the suspension (if it is done right) can make a beneficial benefit but its not something to worry about in the short term. <br>Run a good quality sports (not race tyre) to start off with - it will actually give more grip than a race or full - on trackdas tyre until you are going really quickly. e.g. Dunlop 211RR (not GP)<br>IMO!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/loony888.svg" alt=loony888> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">loony888</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-02-23 01:03:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I weigh 25 lbs more than the OP, and actually had too much preload in the rear, so the stock stuff can be made to work for fatties like me.

So far they have.<br><br>I don't know why, but setting up the suspension is a mystery to me. When I first got my bike, I hated it. It constantly wanted to stand up and run wide. It was definitely not the bike I test rode. It turned out that the dealer set the front compression dampening WAY too high. I dialed that out, and the bike started to behave. Then I had the sag set and the suspension set up properly. That took care of the rest of the problems, like pogoing, but now the bike wanted to stay leaned over after finishing a turn.<br><br>I called the tuner up and he told me to dial one turn of preload out. Now, I'm in bliss. It was an interesting road to get the SD to where it is now. If you know nothing, like I do, go to someone who knows suspensions and have them set it up for you.

Thats it, nothing else. <br><br>I think al lot of the suspension myth comes from a time when standard suspension was crap and aftermarket units set up well did make a substantial difference. The rest comes from watching professional racers looking for that 0.1% improvement that might give them the edge in a close fought contest.<br><br>My point is a simple one, you would be hard pressed to find a good sports bike from the last five or more years where the suspension is a limiting factor for more than a tiny fraction at the very pointy end of the fast group. I spent some years dragging bits of various R1’s, Fireblades, Gixers and others as part of the fast group round many of the UK’s tracks and the only thing holding me back was lack of talent. No amount of upmarket suspension bling would have made any difference at all.<br><br>For the road I like my set up as soft as possible without inducing ground clearance, dive, wobble problems and I firm things up for the track as there are usually less bumps and the breaking forces are higher. I’m not intending to do much on the track with the SD but if I did I’m certain the standard suspension would be well up to the job.<br><br>If you want to go faster on track invest in a good race school, will make much more difference than any amount of bling. Most of the tuning needs to be done between the ears, that was my experience anyway.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/drswade.svg" alt=drswade> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">drswade</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-02-23 17:49:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Now my two cents..or pence...<br>At your weight, you need a stiffer spring on the shock, absolutely. With the stock spring you will need to sacrifice sag for preload. I used the Racetech supplied Eibach 17.8 kg. The stock spring is 17.0. My bike is substantially lighter than stock and I probably could have used the next one up, which is quite a bit stiffer at 19.6 but that seemed too much of a jump for me. There have been cheaper and a better range of spring brands discussed here but I don't recall at the moment. <br>If you take the shock off, Race Tech makes a Schrader type bleeder that replaces the WP proprietary bleed device. I recommend swapping that out while you are there. Your tech will thanks you in the future.<br><br>The fork on my bike feel outstanding. I raced and tracked the bike for two years (YIKES!) before I had them looked at. I just had the bushings replaced and the fluid changed, as well as some other Race Tech School recommended tweaks and I don't feel that they are any different than they were when the bike was new. <br>As you have probably seen from other posts, I have the Nichols triple and shock clevis.<br> <span style="font-weight: bold">These are a huge improvement and mandatory, IMO!</span><br>Someone suggested getting your geometry right first. These parts do just that.<br>Worth every penny!<br>Now, about set up. You really need a competent suspension tuner. The issue is that your bike will never be "set up" as long as you improve your skills/times.<br>Just when the bike feels great, you gain confidence and shave a couple of seconds off your best lap times. The problem is that you are now in need of a tweak to suspension settings at that pace. <br>Sort it out and now more confidence.....drop two seconds and there you are again in need of some tweaks.<br>You get the idea.<br>This is exactly where I was last year as I got faster each time I hit the track.<br>It cracks me up when guys say that they have their bikes dialed in. For what pace? If you are at the top of your game and can't improve, you will still find a little tweaking helps.<br><br>This year there is a chance that I will have Mike Canfield dialing me in this season. If you recall, he was Martin Cardenas' suspension tuner last year. He ended up with a #1 plate in AMA Daytona Sport Bike.<br><br>The SD has an amazing combination of suspension and brakes, right out of the box.<br>Most guys I know that have R1s, etc, spend a shitload of $$$ right away on Ohlins components. Simply not needed until it is needed for the SD, IMO.<br>I would suggest Vesrah SRJL brake pads. They were very instrumental in my dropping lap times. Expensive but INCREDIBLE!</div></p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
