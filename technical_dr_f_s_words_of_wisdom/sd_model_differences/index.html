I currently have a Fireblade (original round headlight version) but lately have been wanting something different. At first I was looking for a more modern 1L superbike like a gixxer or R1 but my riding trends tend to be short (ish) blasts avoiding motorways as much as possible and am currently drawn to the SD as it seems to fit my needs much more than a bum up head down sport bike. I also find the occasional commute to work a bit of a pain as its tricky to look around in that pose, I come up behind guys on FJ's and supermotos in town and they just look more at home, sat up, easy to look around etc it just looks like an easier proposition in traffic.<br><br>One thing I do like about the blade is its grunt from low down. When out riding with mates on modern 600's etc they are tap dancing on the gearbox, high revs etc whereas I can more or less snick it in third and it is good to go (unless things get a bit lairy). How are SD's for this? Looking at the figures it seems to have more power and torque than my ageing Honda, are they grunty enough, I really can't be bothered with high revs etc on the street?<br><br>Also, from what I have seen the SD had a facelift in 07 getting a larger fuel tank, radial brakes and different plastics however when looking on Autotrader and eBay there are bikes claiming to be 08's with non radial brakes etc or is this simply a by product of low sales leading to old stock being registered in later years when sold? My commute to work is a 95 mile round trip and the original ones seem to get comments of 80 miles to the tank, I wouldn't really want to be fuelling twice every ride to work...<br><br>Are there any gotchas or things to watch out for when buying one? I will be looking to get one for around £6k which looks like an 08/09 from what I have seen. I am also wondering if I should keep my Blade or sell it, would the SD be fine for all occasions or do you guys have a different bike to suit what your doing? A group of us passed our test at the same time with rose tinted visions of European tours etc but as usual life has taken over and one by one there has been marriages, children etc which has pretty much put that on hold for a few years, I have just had a baby too (well not me but you know what I mean) so long days out are going to be sparse, the SD seems ideal for blasts up to Trough of Bowland/devils bridge etc<br><br>Cheers,<br>Mark</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TimR.svg" alt=TimR> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TimR</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-02-12 12:52:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>First of all, welcome.<br><br>To answer some of your questions:<br><br>Someone just started another thread asking about the model differences: <a class=postlink-local href="http://www.superduke.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=18742">viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=18742</a><br>Second hand advice can be found in several threads.

You should be able to get 120 miles before reserve if you're commuting and not in heavy traffic.<br>A lot of bikes described as '07 on are actually previously unregistered early bikes. As you point out, the radial brakes and headlight unit facelift are the give-aways.<br>Have you tried Robinsons in Rochdale. If they have any in they should let you take a test ride, although having said that, they're not KTM dealers any more.<br>SD's are pretty versatile - plenty of people tour on them. I've done 1200 miles round Scotland in 4 days. The only downside is luggage choice is limited and windblast above 90 is rather tiresome.<br>They are the perfect bike for A/B road blasts and twisties. As everyone says and as you'll find out if you take a test ride - they tend to put a big smile on your face more than other bikes!<br>You should get a nice low mileage one for £6000. Good luck.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Stratkat.svg" alt=Stratkat> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Stratkat</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-02-12 19:40:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hi Mate.<br><br>I'm from Garstang originally, you know it, just 10 miles north of Preston? Miss those roads up there, the Trough of Bowland over to Settle and the run up to Devils Bridge.<br><br>I think you'd find a good late model SD totally up for everything you'd want. I ended up on one after years of sportsbikes and find that it's a better bike than all of them really. Had it from new so that's five years and before that I had a KTM Supermoto for 5 years. The brand is great and the build is great and the dealers are great - if you find the right one. They are built strong and deal with crashes well. And the parts are cheap if you were used to a Ducati like I was. I go on a lot of track days and it's great for that. Sunday rides it's more than capable of shaming most stuff out there. I've never felt like it has less than I need except on the longer straights on track where up against 180bhp it gets left for dead. But usually I catch up around the bends. <br><br>Go for it, you wont regret it.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/nitrogeoff.svg" alt=nitrogeoff> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">nitrogeoff</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-02-13 10:01:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hey,<br><br>Yeah I know Garstang quite well, used to live in Goosnargh just up the road from there, good roads like you say.<br><br>I know what you mean about the slim twins, my old man got a race 998R and I took that out on the roads, it was quite rough on the throttle but man it was fun with all that torque, jumping back on the blade and it felt a bit lame.

Not really sure what they are - mostly cam profiles I think - sure others on here will fill you in on details. They tend to out put about 15bhp more than the standard SD engine but some say that they don't necessarily make a better road engine - they seem to have more snatchiness problems. Be careful because the first ones - (I think they were '07), did not get the engine mods, they had standard SD engines. <br><br>The Rs have a single seat and a stiffer rear shock spring that raises up the rear by 10mm so the steering is a bit sharper and ground clearance is a bit more. A lot of people, including me, have the orange R 180lb rear shock fitted to their SDs because it suits a rider who is 13 - 14 stone better than the white 175lb standard shock - which has to be set at maximum preload to achieve the right sag.<br><br>The Rs have an orange frame and black parts like the fork bottoms, subframe, disc carriers, swingarm etc. which is purely cosmetic.<br><br>The R single seat back end looks better IMO but you loose the ability to take pillion, depends if this bothers you.</div></p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
