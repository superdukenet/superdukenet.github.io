He seemed to have been meticulous in caring for it (i.e. his other bikes &amp; cars all looked pristine, he had all receipts/records - including one for a new battery last year, bike didn't have a single blemish anywhere). I've ridden it less than 25 miles. No hint of a problem until this failure.<br><br>Bike details:<br><br>07 with only 1400 miles; FMF Apex slip-ons, PCIII w/custom map, MH airbox &amp; SAS block plates; many other accessories, but all cosmetic (all mods done by previous owner)<br><br>Event details:<br><br>While cruising at low speed (45mph) engine cut out suddenly; no sputtering or other drama, just as if I'd hit the kill switch. Now it will crank, but not fire up. Nothing unusual on the display, and the fuel pump makes its normal sound when I turn the key. Visual inspection of all exposed wires &amp; hoses yields no apparent cause. Oil and coolant look clean.<br><br>Diagnostic efforts so far:<br><br>Checked fuses and #5 was blown; this goes to the fuel pump relay, if it's the same as '05 Adventure (for which I have a repair manual). Replaced fuse, but no change in problem.<br>Checked angle sensor in headlamp mask; it was secure.<br>No obvious problems with sidestand or clutch switches.<br><br>Where should I look next?<br><br>Many thanks for your thoughts.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AGRO.svg" alt="AGRO!"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AGRO!</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-05 03:12:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content><span style="color: #004000"><br><br> Check earth wire from PCIII.</span></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Scribe78.svg" alt=Scribe78> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Scribe78</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-05 04:28:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>PCIII wiring traced to BGC and ground terminal on battery -- all looks good.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Scribe78.svg" alt=Scribe78> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Scribe78</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-05 04:30:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>BTW, found fuse listings for SD, and #5 is fan, not fuel pump relay, as on Adventure.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Scribe78.svg" alt=Scribe78> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Scribe78</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-05 04:41:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I would do a search for side stand switch issues here.

After carefully checking everything suggested and making no progress, I took it to the dealer today. They called me just now to say I need a new fuel pump at a cost of nearly $800 for parts and labour. They blamed ethanol for destroying the pump's guts, adding that this was probably made worse by the fact that this bike has been sitting for much of its life (only 1400 miles and it's an '07). <br><br>I can try to find pure gasoline or use an ethanol-antidote additive from this point forward, but now I'm wondering what else might need attention on this bike -- either because of ethanol, in particular, or because the bike has been dormant for most of the last four to five years. Any ideas?<br><br>I was very lucky that this time the bike broke down on a quiet street near my home, and I could easily and quickly retrieve it with my trailer. But now I worry that something else will fail when I'm far from home and/or on a busy highway. I'd much rather try to address likely sources of trouble before they leave me stranded. It sucks to have my confidence shot down on a bike I've only owned for a week and ridden less than 25 miles. Reassurances would be welcome from those with reliable SD's.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Scribe78.svg" alt=Scribe78> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Scribe78</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-06 23:47:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content><span style="color: #004000">When I first read your post I was going to say the fuel pump but from what I read you could hear the pump on turning the ignition on?<br>As for other problems what I think you should do is this <a class=postlink-local href="http://www.superduke.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10932">viewtopic.php?t=10932</a> as the bike has been sitting so long.<br>But what I would do before the water pump seal is flush the cooling system and refill with new coolant and see how it goes plus Dielectric grease in the grey plug.
