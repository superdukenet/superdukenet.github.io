You just need a flywheel puller. <br><br>I'd be interested to see some pics Silverbear of where you machined the metal from the flywheel. This could indeed be a great cheapish mod. Anything that allows the engine to spin up quicker has to be a good thing on track. I would imagine it could make it a bit more snatchy at slower speeds though. Is yours a SD or SDR? Doesn't the SDR have a lighter flywheel anyway?</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=DucatiPete" alt="Ducati Pete"> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Ducati Pete</h3> <time datetime="2014-03-15 12:01:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2014-03-15 12:01:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>My bike is a 2008 SM but they are all pretty much the same and as you say Klinky,the flywheel removal should be pretty easy BUT!.First of all when you start the job,rest the bike up against the wall or what ever leaning toward the right so that when you open the alternator cover,no oil leaks out.Remove the bolt and washer holding the flywheel on with you rattle air,electric gun(if you don't have one may The Lord be with you).There are six Allen screws holding the dog housing thingymigig on the back of the flywheel which I unscrewed but I have a feeling I may not have needed to.To pull off the wheel a 16mm by 1.5 pitch grub screw is screwed into the end of the crankcase so a little is poking out the end.A 20mm by 1.5 pitch bolt is then screwed into the flywheel which pushes on the crank grub screw to force the flywheel off the crank taper.My flywheel thread had already been badly damage from a heavy handed mechanic so when I went to remove mine ,the 20mm bolt trashed the thread.I manage to machine down a three jaw puller to fit and applied some heat and very low rattle gun torque to remove it.Do not buy KTM puller unless money is no object.Buy high grade bolts from your local nut and bolt shop and turn the 16mm bolt into a grub by cutting off the head and cutting a key way for a screw driver to drive it in and out off the crank.If you go to the trouble off removing the alternator cover,it is a good time to change the balance shaft seal to prevent oil blowing out of the crankcase.I removed about 3mm off the outside of the flywheel but be careful because I actually exposed a tiny bit of epoxy which holds the magnet ring on.No big deal but looked a bit how's your father.To balance the wheel I had to machine a foot long axle with a taper to match the wheel.The other end of the taper had a 12 mm spriget to fit the balancer.I also balanced the KTM wheel just in case it was balanced with the crank.The KTM wheel was zero so as long as the new wheel was zero,no balance issues.I have gone a little out of my way but if you do buy another wheel to machine and you zero it in a four jaw chuck as I did, then you shouldn't have to worry about balancing.You will pretty quickly know when you ride the bike if something is out of balance anyway.Another trick to try at the track is to disconnect your charging system and gain the benefit of zero anertia at the magnets.You will have more than enough charge to run one session at total loss charge.I was told that in the Formula Extreme series in OZ which is now our top class,that the bikes are voltage tested after the the race because total loss electronics is banned.Must be good.Im sure Linga will know more.There is a neat little charging system out for pit bikes with a very small flywheel rotating inside a rotor.Nothing for big bikes yet but I shall keep my eye on the ball.Cheers</div> </div> </article> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
