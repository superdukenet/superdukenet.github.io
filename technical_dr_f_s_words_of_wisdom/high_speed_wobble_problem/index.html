It kicks in at around 115-125mph and is totally uncontrollable. Shade will vouch for how mad it looks as when it kicks in and he's following me, he drops back 100yrds just in case Here is what I have tried to do to get rid of it.<br><br>I first noticed it after swapping my top yoke for a nice black one that Bic very generously gave me. My thought was the head bearings had been released and were possibly shot as she had done nearly 32k miles and London speed humps must be murder on them. I didn't actually get that fixed for a while though and waited till the autumn and at the same time got my forks rebuilt by MCT and the SDR shock that I had bought in August had developed a oil leak and went back to Redline for a rebuild. Bike was put back together and the problem appeared to have been cured. <br><br>Recently it has come back again. I really noticed it after fitting a new Power Pure fron to replace my totally worn Racetec. I'm thinking the sharp profile of the tyre showed the problem up again. I decided to swap back the top yoke as just perhaps there is a problem with the one Bic gave me. Went to undo the top nut to find it just finger tight instead of the 25nm it's supposed to be. So I swap it back and torque up to correct setting and head out up A1. Hit 110 and off she wobbles Bugger! <br><br>So I swap yoke back again and repack the bearings and again this makes things a bit better but it's still there. If I give the slightest input at high speed into the bars I can make it wobble like mad. <br><br>Had a new Power Pure fitted on the rear and while there got the guys in tyre shop to see if head bearings, wheel bearing and swing arm bearings felt ok. they said they could feel no play. I though perhaps running around with head not torqued up properly might have fooked bearings again. I had also been doing a few stoppies <br><br>Next I decide to push the forks down through the yokes so rather than 2mm showing they are now 2mm recessed into the yoke. I thought this might help as the rear was raised with the SDR shock. Also the front end has felt a little like she may wash out mid corner especially since the SDR shock went in. I thought it might help with this. I did fear she wouldn't steer as quickly but after taking her out today for a fast Finchingfield blast with Shade I found the steering was just as good and in fact the front end feels far more stable while cornering, allowing me to push a bit harder without the feeling the front end might wash out. Unfortunately although it has made the front end more stable and did tone down the wobble a tad its still there and kicks in at the slightest imperfection in the road at 115-120. i can hit 130 if the road is perfect and keeping a firm grip with legs and light grip with hands helps a little but it's not perfect. I worry about taking her on track like this. Last thing i want is a buddy getting past me because I have to back off at 120-ish <br><br>I have checked suspension setting as they are as she was setup by MCT. The SDR shock wasn't in her then but I got Big Ash's settings off him and they were very close to my own. I will next try setting everything to standard and see if that makes any difference. After that I'm at a loss and will probably have to take it to MCT and get him to rag it down the road and see what he thinks. (he managed to melt my rear when he took it out after setting up suspension came back with big grin saying "she's got some grip on the rear!" I wish I could push her that hard )<br><br>Any suggestions guys are most welcome as I'm kinda scratching my head here as to what is causing the problem. I have also changed both wheels to my spares and that makes no difference.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=TaliG" alt=TaliG> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">TaliG</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2011-05-08 21:37:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2011-05-08 21:37:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>This hapens every time I change her showes ...stops after riding and working the tyres for a while...</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Aussieduke" alt=Aussieduke> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Aussieduke</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2011-05-08 21:43:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2011-05-08 21:43:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Mate you've covered most things.

That bike used a pnumatic element in the damping arrangements and the pressures were different on either side. Once equalised order was restored.

When I repacked the head bearings recently he suggested tightening up and then over tighten to about 35nm. Then have a feel before slackening off again and retighten to correct 25nm torque. At the time I did this it all felt very notchy when over tightened. I thought this was just because it was over tightened. Seems this should not be the case and it should have just felt tight if anything. If the head bearings are shot again this would make sense as my problems all started when I originally changed the top yoke and the bearings were obviously released. Not even sure I properly torqued the head up again on that occasion was my first time changing a yoke and I didn't realise the bearings would be released in this way. My bad and lesson learned. On that occasion the bearing were indeed shot and I had them changed. Repacking them this time did help a bit but didn't get rid of the wobble completely.<br><br>I will check everything else of course but this is what I'm leaning towards now. Hopefully its just the lower bearing as he said this is the one that takes all the stick. The speed humps in London are a fooking joke they really are, not only in size but distance apart. In my road they are every 60 odd meters <br><br>Thanks for all the input guys. I will check things people have suggested. The only thing that changed when this first started was the top yoke thing though. This wobble is exactly the same as that one was.
