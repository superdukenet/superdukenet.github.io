That bike used a pnumatic element in the damping arrangements and the pressures were different on either side. Once equalised order was restored.

When I repacked the head bearings recently he suggested tightening up and then over tighten to about 35nm. Then have a feel before slackening off again and retighten to correct 25nm torque. At the time I did this it all felt very notchy when over tightened. I thought this was just because it was over tightened. Seems this should not be the case and it should have just felt tight if anything. If the head bearings are shot again this would make sense as my problems all started when I originally changed the top yoke and the bearings were obviously released. Not even sure I properly torqued the head up again on that occasion <br><br>Thanks for all the input guys. I will check things people have suggested. The only thing that changed when this first started was the top yoke thing though. This wobble is exactly the same as that one was.

This is exactly the same problem as then and then it was head bearings. I'm only looking at £35 in bearings so not the end of the world. Will check sags again as well as setting everything back to standard.If neither fix the problem though and I'm going to start panicing </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TwistedJester.svg" alt="Twisted Jester"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Twisted Jester</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-10 22:47:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I thought the torque rating was 12nm for the steering head bolt</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-11 06:03:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>your right it is 12nm</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Lowrance.svg" alt=Lowrance> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Lowrance</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-11 13:09:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>If you over torque the steering head bearings during installation you stand a chance of ruining them by dimpling the race surface. This will creat notchiness and I would presume the possibility of some sort of stability issues due to front not being able to center (id caster back to center) smoothly.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Crotchrockety.svg" alt=Crotchrockety> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Crotchrockety</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-11 13:39:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="about.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="terms.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
