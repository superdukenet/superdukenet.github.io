No change. The dealer did advise me that the fuel filter O-ring had disintegrated and was missing pieces. <br><br>Based on the symptoms ("missing" when idling causing the rpm's to drop, erratic richening of mixture while riding, and troubleshooting various causes) I'm wondering if a piece of that O-ring landed in an injector and intermittently causes a blockage or reduced flow to one cylinder. At times of low fuel draw it restricts the injector enough to cut the cylinder and drop the rpm's. Whack the throttle and the fuel blasts through. During regular riding the sometimes restricted flow causes the sensors to detect a lean condition and dump fuel, causing one cylinder to richen up and create very rich exhaust gas, which leaves me reeking of fuel after a ride. <br><br>Until I feel like prying the tank off again I'm gonna run SeaFoam in every tank of gas to hopefully clear the blockage. One day I will pop it off if nothing improves and blow out fuel lines and passages in the throttle bodies, and possibly replace the injectors.<br><br>Does this sound logical at all?<br><br>While at the dealership a proper map was installed based on KTM NA's recommendation as the previous map wasn't correct.

After reading hundreds of posts and several threads I found one where a guy had adjusted the throttle body stop screw to increase the idle just a hair, curing the problem. <br><br>So this evening I popped the left airbox cover off and low and behold, there lies the throttle body stop screws (or whatever you call them). I watched as I opened the throttle and the forward linkage moved a couple millimeters off the screw before the rear linkage picked up. This means the butterfly is closing too far with the throttle closed. So with great difficulty I squeezed a wrench and 2.5mm allen key in and turned the screw up by moving the lock nut about 3/4 of a turn down. FIred her up and she idled up to 2k (hasn't done that in a while) and slowly came back down to around 1400 rpm. Flicked the throttle several times where it would normally die upon returning to idle yet it did not. Turned it off and tried again. Same thing. Buttoned everything back up, tinkered with some other stuff and did it again. No more idle problems! So far...Need to ride it still but for the last several months idling longer than a minute is not something it has done til now.<br><br>This is the screw with yellow paint on it.<br><img src="http://i33.photobucket.com/albums/d74/vafireman21/Super%20Duke/f7b9e1c2.jpg" alt=Image></div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Hotbrakes" alt=Hotbrakes> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Hotbrakes</h3> <time datetime="2012-07-07 15:05:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-07-07 15:05:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Rode 500 glorious miles yesterday in the mountains of WV and she only stalled once, and that was my fault.
