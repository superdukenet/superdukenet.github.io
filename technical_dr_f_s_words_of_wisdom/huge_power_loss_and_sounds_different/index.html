Coming up to a turn I down for a down shift and my throttle cable decides to stick open I pull in the clutch and of course it stays revving away. Out of habit I shut the bike off with my clutch hand. Engine shuts down and the rear wheel locks up because my of my genius self. No biggie I keep it balanced until it finally stops. I hop off and troubleshoot as best I can on the side of the road with no tools but easy diagnosis, the throttle cable won't snap shut when I let go of it. I can still manually force the throttle closed by rotating it forwards, so I hop back on and head home. <br><br>The bike had noooo power on the way back and was very easy to stall from a stop. It also sounded different. No knocking but when I would give it a little gas it would just get louder without accelerating much at all. Obviously I wasn't going to go full throttle or experiment too much with it, I just wanted to get it and me home. Well I pull into the garage and my first solution is to maybe lube up the cable? I open the throttle housing and spray a ton of WD40 into it, making sure it dripped down past the housing. Works like a charm, and the throttle snaps completely shut when I let go of it. Problem solved right? Of course not. <br><br>So this morning I go out and start it up for a ride. Back out of the garage, and as soon as I start to let out the clutch I realised nothing had changed. The throttle cable was fixed but again the bike is very easy to stall and has no power. When I set off again I pulled the clutch in to stop and the revs fell on their face, like the engine barely stayed turning over (maybe 800 RPM?). So I turn the bike around and same thing. I twist the gas and the cable works fine now but it just gets louder without much movement. <br><br>Has my clutch gone out? I just had the fluid changed a few thousand miles ago, and I do remember asking the shop if they had mineral oil and they said that's all they use for clutches. I put new oil in it and I checked the valve tolerances last month and everything checked out. Bike has 30K miles on it, never been raced or ridden super hard.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=990WFO" alt="990 WFO"> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">990 WFO</h3> <time datetime="2015-01-01 19:56:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2015-01-01 19:56:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Oh and one more thing I forgot.

Everything was reassembled and didn't change anything. Bikes revs freely (to 3-4K RPM, didn't want to push it) when in neutral. It definitely doesn't like when a load is applied though, stalled it twice putting it back into the garage. Also it hunts for its idle RPM. Not by a lot but you can definitely notice the needle ticking up and down if you stare at it. To me this is good news, since I believe that is a tell-tale sign of throttle bodies not being synchronized.

If a metal tab was floating around inside the engine I don't see how it's mechanically possible that the bike would even be running. It starts up normally, doesn't make any destructive noises, and spins up freely. A dislodged shim I'll have to look into more, but when the throttle snagged it didn't bounce off the limiter, it just hung out around 6K RPM if I remember right. <br><br>I suspect one of the idiot shops that worked on it earlier this year might have broken the metal tab off, but thankfully removed it. Those guys really suck, but that's in the past. Again, I freaked out like probably anyone would when I noticed a metal tab missing above my throttle bodies. But I am genuinely positive there's no way it found it's way into my engine. I'd see smoke coming out of the exhaust, I'd hear valves being beaten to death, pistons getting scratched to dust, something. I imagine a valve shim that popped out would do something similar. I'm struggling to imagine any piece of metal having room inside the block to just hang out waiting to strike. Something like that would have already destroyed something.

I'm out in the garage, remove the coil pack (it felt very snug so that should eliminate a loose pack issue) and do a resistance check on it. I'm reading 13K from each prong to the output tip of the coil, seems fairly normal. Next is to check the shims. Not a big deal at all. I bust out my special tool from CJ Designs that makes it easier to rotate the crank in order to rotate the piston to TDC. <br><br>OF COURSE the tool strips! And I mean strips, after only like 2 rotations. Granted I used a 12 point socket (with a tight fit), but still. There's no way this thing should be reduced to having only 2 and 1/2 points for a 6 point to grab onto after a few turns. So I spent the next chunk of time trying everything I can to force the socket onto the tool but it's not having it. So I grabbed my stuff out of the garage and walked away, bike still on the rear stand and everything. It can fall over out there for all I care right now. It's just one of those scenarios where I'm like really? You're really going to fight me on every single step of this? That was literally the one and only thing I didn't need to fail for me to check the shims and of course it fails miserably. I pondered marking the cams in their current position and taking them out but the risk vs reward doesn't add up to me. If I put the cams back in even slightly wrong there goes the whole valve train. <br><br>I'm just tired and frustrated right now. Maybe I'll go back out and work on it later but right now I'm pretty upset with how familiar I am with taking my SD apart and putting it back together.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=ktmguy" alt=ktmguy> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">ktmguy</h3> <time datetime="2015-01-04 22:57:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2015-01-04 22:57:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=990WFO" alt="990 WFO"> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">990 WFO</h3> <time datetime="2015-01-05 06:52:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2015-01-05 06:52:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Had similar thing.

Some real heavy-duty stuff too, got the rear cylinder to TDC no problem. Pulled the cam bridge, the cams, and pulled the buckets out. Now I'm not 100% sure on what I'm supposed to be looking for in a stuck shim scenario, but 2 of my shims "fell out" of their buckets. Or at least they weren't all the way seated like they were supposed to be. But then again I have no way of knowing for sure since I pulled my buckets out with a pair of pliers. So it's possible when they popped out they became dislodged. I don't know. As far as just the shims go I don't see any definite way they could have completely stopped the whole cylinder from firing. Even if they weren't seated, the valve tolerances would just be a little off. <br><br>I'm currently waiting on new plugs and the special socket to change out the plugs while the bike is apart as well. I can't see what the current plugs look like so I can't currently check on a failure.

They finally arrived in the mail today <br><br>So I head out to the garage thinking I'll swap the plugs, reassemble everything, start it up and there's a solid chance the bike will be fixed. Well I bust out the CJ Design spark plug socket (like 40 freaking dollars for a 9/16th's socket and a swivel extension, but who cares I have it now). Takes some time to find a good angle due to the frame above the rear cylinder plus how I have my cable management set up. I finally get it in there at the right angle for the ratchet to clear the frame and start twisting. And twisting. And twisting some more...wtf? <br><br>There's no resistance to this thing at all. I even put a good amount of pressure on top to make sure the socket is seated properly. But nothing. I crank this this for like 2 minutes just praying the plug will come out. Nope. I even stuck my telescopic magnet and rattled it around so I could see if the plug was loose or not. The socket never moved it. I think maybe operator error? I bust out the new plugs (KR8DI's) and try a fitment test. OF COURSE the socket doesn't fit. It's ever so slight, but yeah it won't fit. <br><br>So thanks YET AGAIN CJ Designs!! You guys are 0/2 with me with a tool that stripped itself to death after 2 turns and a $40 socket that doesn't even fit what you say it will. And yes, I bought the 07+ socket and yes, my bike is a 2007 model.

Where did the metal tab from the intake go?

Does it backfire or 'chuff' back through the throttle body, particularly the one with the missing tab? Is there any ticking or tapping noise.<br><br>Get the tappet cover off and get the spark plugs out. Shine some light down in there for a look see. You can buy great little sticky beak flexible camera and screen that are perfect for inspecting inside motors. As Guy suggests, check the valve shims are in place.<br>It will still be OK to turn the motor over by hand. Put it up on the rear stand, put it in gear and use the rear wheel to turn the motor over. Does it turn freely? Does it get tight or catch anywhere? (shouldn't get tight anywhere if both plugs are out)<br><br>If there's no obvious damage to the piston/cylinder, shims are good and all seems to rotate freely, valves are moving up and down, put it back together and it should be safe to start. <br><br><br>If I were you, I would go all the way back to this post and follow it. You need to see what is going on it that cylinder before you try to start it again. Stuff like this doesn't fix itself and that plug didn't get like that on it's own. Just my nickles worth, but we race desert racing and had an errant tiny washer that had flipped inside the air filter (don't ask) and it got sucked in and the plug looked like that.

I do appreciate the advice though. And who knows, I may be that guy that ends up completely eating his own words at the end of the day. Or maybe that piece of the air box isn't in there but there is a foreign object in the cylinder. If the engine is destroyed, well....that's going to really suck. I'm storing it for 2 months at my parents place while I'm away at work. And then as soon as I'm back I'm moving to a new state with my next job.

I didn't want to shop around for a camera so I did the next best thing. I stuck my telescopic magnet down there to pick up any possible debris. I have 2 magnets and the one I started with was my heavy duty one, this thing will sweep up bolts/sockets off the ground without even touching them. Anything under 5 lbs and its coming up. Stuck it in there, gave it a few twists, pulled it out and nothing came with it, so that's a big relief. I figured while I had everything apart I would stick my phone in there as well just to make sure. Now I'm no expert on diagnosing mechanical failure, but I see what might be (keep in mind I'm biased, worried/expecting there to be a problem) small scratches on the piston crown. Really small, like 3 of them. Also on the side wall where the spark plug sits, the wall gradually shrinks with smaller and smaller grooves the farther it goes down. One of these grooves is missing about 1/8th of itself O_o...<br><br>I used both my big and small magnet to see if it was a metallic piece sitting on the groove or maybe it was just a collection of oil that looked like a solid. But upon using my small magnet and phone to really poke at it to see if it moved, I realised that a small piece of that groove is missing. Couldn't be very big at all though, just a small metal shaving. Might have gotten past the exhaust valve? I triple checked with both magnets, nothing magnetic is sitting on the piston at TDC. <br><br>If anyone is willing to post my pics/small video I took I'll email it to them so they can upload it here. I'm not 100% sure if I should be worried or not, this goes a little outside of my experience.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=ktmguy" alt=ktmguy> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">ktmguy</h3> <time datetime="2015-02-23 21:14:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2015-02-23 21:14:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Aphex" alt=Aphex> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Aphex</h3> <time datetime="2015-02-23 21:18:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2015-02-23 21:18:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Here is the image: <img src="http://i.imgur.com/06oPB3b.jpg" alt=Image><br><br>and the video with link incase embedding doesn't work for whatever reason: <br><br></div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=990WFO" alt="990 WFO"> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">990 WFO</h3> <time datetime="2015-02-23 21:20:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2015-02-23 21:20:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Sorry for the mostly useless vid.

I'm going to put in the new battery and start her up. I'm being flown out to TN on Thursday and Friday, driving to MD Saturday and Sunday, work the next week, and then that weekend I have to have all my stuff packed/stored for me being away at work for 2 months straight. A good friend of mine is holding onto my bike and car while I'm away during that time. If the rear head is toast that's 2 months straight either they or a shop could be rebuilding it for when I get back. And if the head is already damaged, I'm not going to do much worse by starting it again. A bent valve is a bent valve, whether its 1 or all 4, it still need an overhaul. <br><br>I'll lower the piston a little later today and take another look for any debris.

Lowered the piston a little and tilted the camera and boom: hemispherical scratches below the exhaust valves. The piston itself is surely fine, these are just surface scratches. But now I can honestly say it's likely I've bent at least one valve. So the project is now probably going to leave my hands. While my bike is in storage while I'm away I'm going to see if I can't get it worked on in the mean time. Anyone know of a good shop in North Carolina? So far my rebuild is covering the following:<br><br>-Pull both heads and check for further damage, replace valves/piston as needed<br>-Port/polish both cylinder heads<br>-Retune<br><br>Not 100% sure on how much it'll cost. I know a rebuild on non-performace car engines is typically $1000-$1500.
