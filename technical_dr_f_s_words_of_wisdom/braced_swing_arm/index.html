Check out their website photo gallery, they've done loads of one-off frames and modded a lot of swing arms.<br><br>Not got a confirmed price yet but need to send them my drawings.

I've been lucky enough to race the Superduke, the Superduke R, and the Superduke R with a braced swingarm - same tracks, same conditions, same tyres, all different configurations of Superduke. Trust me the braced swingarm is a huge improvement. The bike changes direction more positively, turns at high speed more stable and consistent, and (for some reason I can't explain why) seems to put the power to the ground more predictably - you can drive out harder, earlier, with less lateral movement/wallowing. Doesn't take race pace to feel the difference either. Those little arms flex..<br><br><br>and the only times I've really had an issue was high speed cornering (as Ash saw at Bedford) and when putting the power on coming out of corners. I've been in touch with one custom fabricator and asked for a ball park figure to brace my swingarm (and asked if I could get discount for more than one!). I'm not sure what to expect but I think it will be cheaper than a suspension overhall (the one for my SM was £500!!). I also don't think there is a lot of point getting the suspension set up for my weight as I am an average weight, so the suspension is set up for my weight anyway.<br><br><br>I'll be keeping this thread updated as and when I find out more.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MacBoarder.svg" alt=Mac_Boarder> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Mac_Boarder</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-02-04 03:42:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Willh.svg" alt=Willh> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Willh</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2016-01-09 13:47:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I have just hit the road again on my 990 after a complete rebuild of the swing arm.I have braced it similar to GoGo Racing SDR990 but went a little further with a Superbike Quick change set up similar to Harris Performance.The bracing was needed because I track the bike frequently and swing arm wollowing and suspension squatting was quite noticeable.I'm also forever rotating my tyres from road to track and back to road after each trackday so I was after a faster,easier way to change tyres so studied up on Endurance Racing quick wheel change engineering and decided on the Harris Performance set up.I was amazed at the improvement I could feel just on the public road.It felt like someone was holding up the rear end while I was riding and I was turning in way to early because the rear didn't squat and sharpened my steering angle.Powering through corners before was good but now it feels like I'm on a rail because the rear end is so stable.Just in case some of you may be thinking maybe my suspension was'nt set up right in the first place(which is a fair call)I have had some of the best suspension gurus Australia has to offer to help set up my bike.I currently have Frank Pons,a very well known Ozzy and international tuner rebuild my suspension and had him trackside helping with adjustments at Toprider Track and Coach days in Sydney.One of the reasons for the improvement is less weight on the rear end.I machined the axle out of 7068T6(35% stronger than 7075T6) and weighs 1/3 of the steel original.The large rear caliper and bracket are replaced with an under slung Bellinger billet calliper with the bracket as part off the axle slider(almost 50% weight saving ).Apart from the stainless DIY slider adjuster bolts,all the fastening hardware is Titanium and the chain is a 520 DID heavy duty item which is a kilo lighter than the 525.before the project was started I painstakingly machined every surface of the swing arm so with all the bracing and new axle sliders, the weight is the same as the original swing arm.Unless someone can tell me how to post pics from my 4 year old IPad,I am unable to post pics.Cheers</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2016-01-09 13:55:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content> <br>Use photobucket for uploading the pics.
