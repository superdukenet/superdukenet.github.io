Replaced first with KTMtwins Sigutech slave. Bled from both ends, with solid feel. Clutch would't release. Re did the job 3 times with same result. Checked to make sure I wasn't missing the ball and measured the depth to the ball on both. The stock was 3mm shallower than the so I thought that could be the problem. KTMtwins sent me a replacement that was the same depth as the stock OEM. Great service! Also ordered an Oberon with the support plate in aluminium to compare. I have replaced and bled all 3, including the OEM, and the clutch handle feels solid in it's normal travel range, bled the master cylinder each time as well made sure no bubbles coming from either end, even had it sit overnight and rebled, but no change. The clutch will not release. Checked to make sure the depth to the ball was the same in all of them. Bled on shop stand and on side stand to see if angles made any difference? I have done this on many other bikes, BMW, Aprillia etc with no problem, have also bled brakes etc. without any issues.

Lets just ignore the oil jet for the moment.<br><br>You say pressure feels Ok but clutch won't release. I assume you mean that when you pull the clutch lever it feels as though the<br>thing is working and when you release the lever the clutch doesn't engage the engine (it is slipping without drive). It is possible that you mean the <br>opposite in that the clutch doesn't spread the plates and thus never disengages. Which one is it?<br><br>You can differentiate between the two by engaging a gear and just pushing the bike. Does it move or doesn't it. If it doesn't then pull in the<br>clutch lever. What happens now? Either way you can confirm by removing the clutch-side cover and just looking.<br><br>I assume it the clutch works but when you release it sounds like you are saying that the thrust plate doesn't fall back and allow the clutch to engage. If<br>this is the case we need to find out why? I'd look to see if you have somehow bent the clutch rod and it is sticking in the sleeve. If<br>it isn't bent and doesn't return perhaps it is gummed up. The oil jet would help here. If the clutch is permanently disengaged<br>then you've missed out a component on the slave side such as the adapter spacer plate or the chain securing guide. Make sure you've got<br>both and that they are seated properly.<br><br>If the thrust plate is not activated then the problem is obviously over at the slave side.<br>Take it off and gently pull the lever a bit. Is the piston operating? If the piston is up against the circlip push it back in gently first but<br>keep an eye on overflow at the Master. If it is working as I assume then you've got to work out why the piston isn't pushing the thrust<br>rod when assembled. Make sure that the pin is not only in but is fitting into the corresponding groove in the adapter plate. It needs<br>to be turned slightly sometimes because if it isn't in the right place things won't seat properly.<br><br>Let us know the outcome of the series of steps.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=galobos" alt=galobos> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">galobos</h3> <time datetime="2013-08-08 05:21:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2013-08-08 05:21:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>What I mean by the clutch won't release is that if I place the trans in gear with the engine off and pull the clutch lever in, the rear wheel is still in gear and won't move. I've tried starting the motor in neutral to let it warm up thinking that after sitting for a while there is so much stiction in the clutch plates that they wouldn't release. When I pull the clutch lever in, and go to shift it into 1st, the engine cuts out before going into gear. If I leave the engine off, I can push the bike with the clutch lever in, but there is a LOT of clutch drag. I haven't removed the clutch side cover yet.<br><br>I hope this clears up what I meant to say happens, at least a little. When I mount the slave, it does seem that the slave cylinder is compressed when I tighten up the bolts which suggests that it should work?
