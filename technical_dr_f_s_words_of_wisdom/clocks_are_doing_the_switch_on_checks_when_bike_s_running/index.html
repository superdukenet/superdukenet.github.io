Not sure if it happened before as well. <br>My dealer told me that the clock were once replaced for some reason he's not sure of (it was replaced under warranty apparently, in a different dealership). <br><br>So, what do you think?</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=fazer1000" alt=fazer_1000> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">fazer_1000</h3> <time datetime="2012-06-17 22:29:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-06-17 22:29:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>The youtube link:<br><br></div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=41KS" alt=41KS> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">41KS</h3> <time datetime="2012-06-17 22:44:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-06-17 22:44:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Apparently the ECU is working as engine is running during malfunction.

Buttoned everything back up and took her for a spin and the clocks did the same thing. What fixed it for me (and I know this sounds odd but) was a healthy dose of WD40 sprayed all over the connectors outside the battery case on the left side of the chin spoiler. I basically used the spray to clean off any accumulated gunk and as I was, I heard an electrical noise from above near the headlight mask. I cleaned off the excess and started her up. Revved her real good and could not duplicate the issue. I've put two hundred miles or so on her and she's still running great. Hope this helps.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=fazer1000" alt=fazer_1000> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">fazer_1000</h3> <time datetime="2012-06-23 05:47:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-06-23 05:47:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>I was having the same problem you are describing, plus the "FI" would flicker on and off after I turned the ignition off, and I would hear a clicking sound. I charged the battery and no change. Voltage was good at 12.8, and 14 running, but no change yet. No loose connections at the battery, or at the surrounding wires. I finally dropped the headlight facia..the two bolts on top removed and facia swings down on a hinge..same process to change the headlight bulb. Anyways, the connectors on the right side came loose and one came completely off. I plugged them back all in securely, zip tied, and taped them to make sure they did not come loo se again. All in all, this solved the problem. No more clock reset, no more dat errors, and no more soft errors.</div> </div> </article> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
