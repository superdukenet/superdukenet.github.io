If you are thinking of having a go then take extra care when removing the LCD screen from the unit and try not to bend any of the pins. If you are thinking of replacing these like Silverbear suggests then OK but if you're planning to just take a look and reassemble then don't bend any of the pins because it makes it very, very hard to get them all back into position and press home without bending them more. I've been playing about for a few hours with my old spare unit and you need a lot of patience. If you do get into trouble then you need to try and get them as straight as possible and then put the screen at a bit of an angle so one end of the pins goes in first and gently work your way along the line of pins using a scalpel or fine point to guide each one at a time into its hole. Once they are all started you can press down and fit the unit into place. <br><br>My other working unit stopped working again yesterday so I've decided to go ahead and buy the new unit. But I will try and do the fix on the broken one and see if I can get it working again.<br><br>One other bit of advice. When dismantling the unit try not to do it on a table where the kids have been making Christmas cards and the place is covered in that fine glitter. It gets everywhere and you cannot get it all cleaned off. Thank goodness this was just a spare set and not a potentially good one. </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Aphex.svg" alt=Aphex> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Aphex</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-12-21 19:54:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Thanks for the tip BIC!

I have the right top and center bars of the digital 8 throughout the complete panel become light gray instead of solid black. in every single digit, time, speed, odometer its the same so something is failing and I'm not sure I can take it apart and fix it.<br><br>Now, A few weeks ago, on my first ride after washing the bike, I had moisture inside the lens that was covering the speed and after a few hours it dried out and went away. I imagine that THAT has something to do with my issue but again, not wanting to open it up not knowing what to look for inside. I keep my bike inside the garage and it rarely sees rain. <br><br>Best of luck trying to figure out electrical gremlins Bic.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/jmann.svg" alt=jmann> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">jmann</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-12-24 01:48:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Umm Comrades: Some years ago I used to buy all of the clocks that I could find on ebay.

When they are first fitted the calibration is set to kph so you have to change it to mph by holding down the mode button for 12 seconds. Graphics and outer plastic moulding have changed with the new model but the connections and attachment is identical.
