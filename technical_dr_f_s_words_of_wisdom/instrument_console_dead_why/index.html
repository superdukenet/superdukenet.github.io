If you are thinking of having a go then take extra care when removing the LCD screen from the unit and try not to bend any of the pins. If you are thinking of replacing these like Silverbear suggests then OK but if you're planning to just take a look and reassemble then don't bend any of the pins because it makes it very, very hard to get them all back into position and press home without bending them more. I've been playing about for a few hours with my old spare unit and you need a lot of patience. If you do get into trouble then you need to try and get them as straight as possible and then put the screen at a bit of an angle so one end of the pins goes in first and gently work your way along the line of pins using a scalpel or fine point to guide each one at a time into its hole. Once they are all started you can press down and fit the unit into place. <br><br>My other working unit stopped working again yesterday so I've decided to go ahead and buy the new unit. But I will try and do the fix on the broken one and see if I can get it working again.<br><br>One other bit of advice. When dismantling the unit try not to do it on a table where the kids have been making Christmas cards and the place is covered in that fine glitter. It gets everywhere and you cannot get it all cleaned off. Thank goodness this was just a spare set and not a potentially good one. </div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Aphex" alt=Aphex> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Aphex</h3> <time datetime="2015-12-21 19:54:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2015-12-21 19:54:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Thanks for the tip BIC!
