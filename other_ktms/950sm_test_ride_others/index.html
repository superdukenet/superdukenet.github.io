Dual Akra system, sounded mean! Torque everywhere really, no snatchiness whatsoever, smooth and grunty at the same time! Engine was superb! Responsive handling, great really. Nothing to really complain about... BUT. After a second test-ride to compare it to the RSV Mille R and HyperMotard it just didn't feel right. You sit up on the perch of a seat way up there off the ground. The bars sitting above your waist, it didn't feel natural. Maybe some like it but I just didn't feel confident like on the Dukes. I really wanted to like it, price was right! <br> <br>In summation: The thing just felt huge and as if I was way up above the ground, and ON the bike not a part of it. Impressive, technically sound machine but it didn't gel with me. <br> <br>Question: I haven't ridden a SD yet (plan to SOON), how will it compare? How will it compare to Monster 1100S ergos? <br> <br> <br>IF YOU WANT A LONG READ HERES MY IMPRESSIONS OF A FEW OTHER BIKES FROM TODAY: <br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline">2001 Aprilia RSV Mille R</span>: This was outstanding.. I thought the 950 had power. Had me laughing in my helmet after the first left hander and roll-on! The front came up on me good in 2nd once half-way through the gear while rolling it on and surprised the hell out of me. Precise is the word I would use about this bike, it really is a race bike through and through and its obvious from the first 100 yards you're on the thing. Flicking the bike side to side took little effort and it would be amazing setup properly. I think the suspension was a bit stiff for me (even for the street) and I didn't feel confident because of that but otherwise no complaints. Maybe not the smoothest gearbox but I don't baby it anyways, so no problem. And also obviously the seating position was very aggressive; it felt a little tight for my 6' frame (sort of felt as if my head was far forward, almost above gauges making it difficult or useless to check them)but maybe it was just me not used to the bike. <br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Ducati Hypermotard</span>: Upon riding this bike, right away I felt pretty confident, more so than the previous two. Some things you can't explain, some I'll try: Lower seat than the KTM and it felt a little more sane (little less power but NOT less fun). As far as having a good time I don't know if the Hyper could be topped for more "normal" situations and tight curves. Torque down low is strong and the seating position is different but good. You don't see the bike at all really (which I kind of liked). Brakes were spot on, everything was right on this bike (except maybe the small gas tank). As far as having a damn good time on 2 wheels without almost dying at every turn I like the option of a Hyper.. I think I will eventually have one (or something similar). Loved it! Only criticism is the bit of twitchiness of the throttle really low in RPM (I think exhaust/tuning helps that though). <br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Ducati Monster 1100S</span>: I wasn't going to demo this, only after riding the KTM the 2nd time and deciding it wasn't for me and Rick (one of the guys at Pro Italia) recommending I ride it did I hop on. I wasn't real keen on a monster to be honest, I thought they were for people who didn't really know how to ride a sportbike and just wanted to putt around town. I saw them as an in-between bike that I didn't have interest in (thought the power wouldn't be enough either). I sat on one and it didn't feel good necessarily. <br> <br>WRONGGGGGGGG. This bike was perfect, perfect, perfect (to me at least). Sitting on one is much different than riding one let me tell you that. Upon pulling the clutch out for the first time in 1st gear I felt I had ridden this bike my whole life! It really was remarkable to me how perfect it felt; I couldn't have been more at ease in the seat on a bike for the first time. While riding, partly due to the wind hitting you the pressure is off your wrists and allows you to be loose (something you don't feel sitting on one in the showroom). The bike's feel was lower to the ground which I felt was better also. The slightly forward riding position is semi-aggressive, allowing you to really go after those corners or lay back and dodge traffic with light arms. I went through the curves nearby on auto-pilot, the Ohlins probably helped but it was thoughtless and beautiful. <br> <br>The pull from down low is not something for the light-hearted either; this thing will definitely give you a grin (especially so when that front wheel is skyward and you can't help but smile when it comes down, thinking about that SUV behind you who must be thinking wth is that guy doing?). <br> <br>Sorry to rave here can't help it. Everything was excellent on this motorcycle. I really felt more one with the bike and the road than anything I've been on. I don't see any reason for more power than this on the streets unless you are really looking to haul ass on some canyon roads. I don't see any good coming to me from doing that though... <br> <br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline">In Conclusion</span>: Something about the Ducatis I can't explain, they just felt "RIGHT." I''m shaking just thinking about the rush from this afternoon! If the Hyper had a little more room in the gas tank I would probably consider it more, they are both excellent machines. The Monster is everything I want in a bike though, FUN (#1 factor), good enough for traffic-weaving &amp; commuting, hitting up canyon roads, gobs of torque, power but not TOO much, sticks to the road, light and agile, confidence-inspiring, (and lets be honest) Italian! Air-cooled engine is proven as well; only issue is I think it could use an exhaust upgrade (noticed some backfiring, etc.) and tuning/ECU. <br> <br>I'm trying to figure out a way to justify financing the Monster and spending a good portion of my paycheck just to have one; I think it would be worth it... I have no other expenses besides basics hell why not! I still have to test-ride a Superduke though, which is smaller than the supermoto and lower, more aggressive stance with the same power. I'll report back..</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/tyler.svg" alt=tyler> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">tyler</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-02-19 11:59:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/weeksy.svg" alt=weeksy> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">weeksy</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-02-19 18:46:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/tyler.svg" alt=tyler> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">tyler</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-02-20 08:04:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/weeksy.svg" alt=weeksy> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">weeksy</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-02-22 19:07:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
