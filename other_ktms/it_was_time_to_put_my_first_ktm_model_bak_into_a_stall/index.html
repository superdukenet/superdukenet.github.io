It was a great toy around here for afternoon forays. I was sitting at the computer, nursing my wheelie gone bad ass and bruized right foot. Craigslist Slo motorcycles is bookmarked for everyday perusal and lo and behold a Duke II posted up six hours ago. I paid too much for the condition it is in but I also know that it would take a drive to faraway places to capture another. I told my wife I would be buying this bike as it is far better at wheelying than the bike I just crashed. A 2000 with 26000 hard earned miles, the bike looks like no motorcycle that is in my stead. The first and only ride to make sure in ran through the gears and stopped was a travel back in space and time of seven years. There is nothing on this motorcycle that money won't fix. I'll throw wads at it and am sure I'll wad it up just after I do.<br><br>Let the games begin.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-07-03 20:44:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Lookin' good.<br><br>Never had an Orange one. 1x Champagne <br><br>Don't suppose that neat bash plates a KTM part?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-07-03 21:33:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I had an early wire wheel LC4 Supermoto before the 990.

I started stripping it down the day it landed. It revealed a rear subframe purchased from a junkyard, a headlight cowl filled with numerous wiring "upgrades", air intake ducting cracked and splattered with silicone caulking, miscellaneous muckery poorly disguised as Ethiopian engineering, a magnetic drain plug with enough iron to build a small railway system including the caboose.<br>The saddest part of this rebuilding project is my blatant disregard for decent mechanic practices. I decided that rather than follow cautious disassembly methods and take lots of pictures and bag and label parts as they came off the bike I would just convince myself that I could channel my not ever used before photographic memory and my never seen before master mechanic prowess. I now find myself staring at parts on the bench I swear I have never seen before and could not have possibly have come off the Duke. I have found that the best of my qualifications seem to be in cleaning the parts. The parts that I do not know where they go are wire brushed and good as new. the parts that I have a vague idea are part of the duke I have decided to leave dirty for fear that if they are clean and shiny will not look like they belong and I will forget where they go.<br>I figure I'll break it down a bit further and this might help with the recall. I am going to still run with the photographic memory method as I am sure it just takes a bit more disassembly for it to kick in. Really, how hard can this be..<br><br><br></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/JohnJJr.svg" alt=JohnJJr> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">JohnJJr</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-07-22 21:08:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I do the same thing all the time man.... take too much apart and then forget what goes where lol.<br><br>Hopefully it's not as bad as its starting to seem.. you'll get it up in top shape soon enough!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-07-22 21:19:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-07-23 05:21:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>[quote= a magnetic drain plug with enough iron to build a small railway system including the caboose.<br>[/quote]<br><br>you guys can laugh at me - won't be the first time - i run Amsoil in my 07 SD with 40K on the clocks - had the rev limiter bumped to 10,300 at 8k miles when i did all the mods - pulled the magnetic plug to change oil last time and there wasn't a speck of metallic dust on it - nada - nothing . whiped it with a rag and was just clean as a whistle.<br><br>PS. i bump that 10,300 limit all the time <br>PPS. no power drop off either - pulls strong all the way.<br><br>i don't know why i said this but did ha !<br><br>Oh - i know what i forgot - i have trouble remembering where stuff goes too - and will start using my cell phone to take photos of dis assembly in the future</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/BassAgent.svg" alt=BassAgent> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">BassAgent</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-09-03 05:25:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Well as luck would have it this Duke II rebuild is a long involved ordeal. I pulled the wheels off to have them stripped and re-powdercoated only to find a tube installed under the front tyre. Before the full removal of tyre I asked myself, Who would be foolish enough to run a tube on a tubeless rim. The answer was quite clear when I saw the botched repair weld. SHIT. Lucky me I had a replacement rim sitting under 1/4" of wood dust way in the back of the shop. I bought this wheel along with it's rear counterpart way back in 05 when I had my original Duke II, waiting for the day it would be needed. Well just for shits and giggles I decided to mount the rim sans new tyre while waiting for the new tyres to arrive. I gave it a good spin after mounting only to find that it was as warped as my sense of humour. So now both wheels are off to Sacramento for costly repairs. This bike has given me plenty of tinker time and for that I am not unhappy. It has asked me to reach into my wallet far more than I had originally estimated. I spend countless hours on eBay looking KTM Duke II parts. There have been three KTM Dukes for sale and there is one there now for $5500 buy it now that is in emaculate condition with a flat slide carb and Akrapovic exhaust. It makes me feel like the same sucker I was when I was twelve and bought my first motorcycle from paper route money. Any way as luck would have it The American Remus distributor is having a clearance sale on inventory that has been collecting dust in their warehouse and lo and behold I bought a new complete system for a considerable savings. They were so kind as to include the headers for the price of just the exhaust cans. They have a SD990 exhaust discounted on eBay now along with quite a few other models systems. Look under Remus exhaust I would guess.<br><br>By the way she'll be red now as that is the color that I had the most spare plastics for. <br>The Duke II sold in the states for only two model years the last one being 2001. I am have the hardest time buying factory parts and was wondering if purchasing parts from maybe Canada would wield better luck.<br>Duke II $2000.00<br>parts $1500.00<br>I am officially upside down now let's hope the bike doesn't end up the same.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Willh.svg" alt=Willh> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Willh</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-09-07 04:57:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I installed my new Remus exhaust today. The fit and finish is top shelf. I had no idea that Remus was an Austrian company until the box showed up. I feel like I got an exhaust from a company that is at least drinking at the same bar as Akrapovic and KTM evan if they are doing shots of vodka with a Red Bull chaser.<br>The fit was as good as I have ever experienced when mating up to factory connections. The sound is spectacular. I never wanted to have to live with the stock exhaust and it is serendipitous that this system appeared in such a timely manner.<br>I can highly recommend Remus exhausts without the least bit of trepidation.<br><br><br>Yes that is the new SD turn signals, they look rather flashy if I say so myself.<br></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-09-07 10:31:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Where's some full pics of the bike Drib?!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-09-07 12:51:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hey Drib, I think you need a bigger washer on that license plate screw <br><br>I've been missing my 640 a bit lately.
