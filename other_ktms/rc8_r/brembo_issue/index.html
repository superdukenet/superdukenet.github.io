Did a bunch of work on her and she is fast.I hope we can get a bunch of us at Chuckwalla in April.I will bring the duke and the RC8 The duke is running great and loves chucky.The RC8 I know will need some help in the susp dept.I promised the Nerd he could ride it so Nerd lets have some fun.I cant wait I am going to ride the shit out of it out here then put some new corsa's on her should be a blast I changed the gearing so it has more low end and less top end.I will never use it anyway.So If any of you guys have any problems with your rear brake like having to step very hard to get it to work that could be a sign.One is the duke is so easy to ride and at Chucky it seems to fly there.Th RC8 I find it harder to get used to but am looking forward to see the differance going thru turns at speed.I just hope I can ride it like I rode the duke.Can't wait to see how much faster I can go .I got some great input last time really helped many thanks to the guys on the forum.So lets see how many we can get out there this April and tear it up and have some fun last time was so great.This time I guess we will go the regular way so it will be new to me.John I hope you can go your the reason I got to do it the first time helped me a lot and your welcome to try the RC8 for a few laps.I never have a problem riding the duke there for sure.Just glad the weather is ridable hope to take the duke out a little wed for some twisty fun.I just want to get back on the track so bad it's all I think about.It's the only thing that clears my head from all the crap in my everyday life.Without it I would go crazy.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Boatcephus.svg" alt=Boatcephus> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Boatcephus</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-01-18 17:41:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>do you have aftermarket/KTM hardparts rear sets? <br><br>some aprilia RSVR riders have complained about the rear brake's function caused by the MCs orientation (horizontal). even after following the correct bleeding procedure - due to the bleed hole being at bottom of the caliper. after installing rear sets which relocates the rear master brakes improved. <br><br> can't see my RC8 right now but I think it's parallel to the ground as well. aftermarket rear sets will move the master so it's perpendicular</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/kowekiller.svg" alt=kowekiller> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">kowekiller</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-01-18 22:20:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>My rear sets are not stock. They are rizoma I like them they have several adjustments and do change the position of the mastercylinder.In fact the bike they use on there home page when you look up RC8 looks just like mine same color.This thing has been a nightmare.We changed out everything so all is new The M/C was bad maybe because it had to work so hard to move the pistons on the caliber.Who knows? We looked up the records and this problem has been going on since new.We are on the third caliper all were new from KTM.They even put the thing together on the bench before install and still did not work.Then My friend got the pads out half way by hand then they worked fine.Like I said when they went back to the flat position they could not get the pistons to push out the pads.So we are hoping that by honing out the area and making it easy for the pistons to move freely it will solve the problem.Some thing is making them hang up so they don't move in and out.It has been there for over a month.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Lowrance.svg" alt=Lowrance> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Lowrance</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-01-19 04:21:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Update got the caliper to work. but still not enough to build pressue to stop the rear wheel.So now it seems it could be a problem with the rear sets since they change the position of the master cylinder and use some differant parts.I got a call into Rizoma USA I can't believe that they make a product that does not work. Their website has a picture of my bike same color. In all my years of motorcycles I have never seen anything like this.All I want are my rear brakes to work.Do I have to go back to stock to make it work.These rear sets are made by a good company that makes all kinds of good stuff.They are not cheap crap.Has anyone had any problems with rizoma rear sets? I know many other bikes that use these and have had no problems.Please anyone have any clue to what the fook is the problem.

They just don't see enough of them.I wonder how many are in the USA total.I will abide to the Klinks commands.When I ride the piss out of her in the next couple of week I will let you know how it goes.Trust me guys I feel lucky I can have both. I just hope I can ride it like my duke. The duke gives me so much confidence.The RC8 is just so fast talk about a hooligan.Good tracks days comming at Chucky .John it's all your fault brother you got me hooked.
