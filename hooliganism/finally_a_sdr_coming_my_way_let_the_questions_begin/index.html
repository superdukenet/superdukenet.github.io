I know you're thinking "Intro" section, but I have much more to say, and to ask, than a simple introduction.<br><br>I've been a Member on here for quite some time... although not active. Mostly perusing, browsing, lurking in the shadows.. reading GoGo's posts and happy to see the SD setup and functioning WELL as a proper race machine, as I like to see validated results, not just hearsay from people I do not know online.<br><br>I've learned first-hand experience is MUCH more valuable to how setup motorcycles. Sometimes flying in the face of what people on the internet, magazines and the like have to say.<br><br>As for me, I'm a young albeit experienced road rider/racer in Florida who has ridden a fair share of bikes in my few short years on two round hoops of rubber. I raced a Daytona 675 last year, for the first time, yet it went extremely well considering we setup the bike single handedly with no experience (10 trackdays) and no help to mention... yet were running within a couple seconds of Podium-class Expert lap times on a stock machine (with stock exhaust/suspension) at Jennings and Homestead, FL tracks. Sadly that bike and I hit an oil spill going into turn 10 at homestead and is no longer with us...<br><br>But a NEW Day is here! I will be taking delivery of a 2008 SD-R (1500mi, used) next Friday, a bike I have waited quite some time to throw a leg over and call my own.<br><br>I have read my fair share of posts, but I still have a few questions, and please mind me for not just using the Search function.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">-Fueling &amp; Maps-</span><br>Does the SDR have a CAT installed in the pipes, or is the CAT in the y-pipe, mufflers?..<br>What is the real story here? <br>I've read everything from using a stock map on slip-on pipes with no mods, to Akra Map/Akra Pipes (yet I read this is too rich without other mods), 02 eliminators, PC III, MH Airbox, SAS removal and blockoff plates... balance the throttle bodies (obviously?)... It's giving me a headache just thinking about it.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">-Pipes, Pipes, Pipes-</span><br>No, not that kind... So the SDR comes with the Akra SS headers (once again does stock exhaust system have a CAT?)<br>Are any slip-ons any better than any other? I am looking at purchasing FMF Apex exhausts because I love the look, and they can be had about $350 less than Akras.<br>How would the bike run on slip-ons and stock airbox (with a stock map, and with the Akra map from the dealer?)<br><br>Can someone give me a simple, straight-forward answer as to the cheapest/easiest way to sort the bike's fueling without being OBSESSIVE. I just want it to run pretty well ASAP, not blow up, and not kill me coming off no-throttle, and I can fine tune it later (TuneECU, MH Box?). Of course, when I ride the bike I will have a much better idea as to where it is, what needs to be done, etc.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">-Handling, Suspension &amp; Triple Tree-</span><br>Foreword: I weight 160lbs, I am an aggressive rider. I will probably track this bike if I feel confident on it. I may race it in the future.. That being said:<br>I've read a bit about the Nichols triple developed for this bike (specifically for the SD-R I believe) and also how the clevice adds height adjustment to the rear.<br><br>BUT, does another rear shock offer height adjustment in the rear, besides using a nichols clevice? And how necessary is the triple, especially if you are able to adjust rear ride height and have the front end raised all the way? And let me reiterate, I am not trying to toot my horn, but I am not in the 99% that does not use a motorcycle anywhere near it's capability, so please refrain from "you won't notice" and whatnot comments. <br><br>ONE MORE THING,<br>What bars does everyone recommend? Especially for a forward-biased, track focused body position? I have seen GoGo recommend Streetfighter bars, which were nice when I rode one of those. I also owned a Monster 1100S and the bars on that bike were PERFECT. I actually have a set of slightly bent ones I could try out on the SDR..

It is located in the silencer inlet, and the factory silencer is a heavy 1 into 2 design. You will be able to use the stock akra headers and pipe to the silencer connection. I have Akra Evo silencers on my bike, but there are quite a few other great choices available that would likely perform and sound very similar.<br><br>Once the cat is gone, you can remap in a variety of ways as you've seen. On my SDR, I had the akra map flashed at my local KTM dealer. It smoothed response a little. Then I installed a Motohooligan airbox, SAS blockoff plates and Motohooligan secondary throttle plates. The last three things were done at the same time and really smoothed things out. I also installed O2 eliminators, although I've read the sensors are disabled by the Akra map. The bike has much smoother throttle response and pulls stronger throughout the rpm range now, not to mention it sounds amazing.<br><br>The secondary throttle plates are located at the uppermost point on the throttle bodies. Look for a Youtube video of the Motohooligan Motobox and you will find videos showing how they interact with the primary throttle when the engine is running.<br><br>I can't speak much about suspension because I haven't had a chance to do a trackday. I'm certain its a great trackbike, and contrary to what some articles say, I think its a very comfortable street bike. I had a Monster S2R 800 previously, and the SDR ergonomics are spades better. I can't comment on a comparison with the current gen Monster.<br><br>Installing all of the above is straight forward. Bic Bicknell, a member here, made an outstanding installation guide fot the Motohooligan airbox and it can be found on this site. Riding the SDR stock is fun, but doing the above mods makes it a better bike and more fun.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/tyler.svg" alt=tyler> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">tyler</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-06 01:00:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Okay, so the CAT is removed with the stock silencers being removed?.. If so, great! Looking at various slipons now, I like the look of FMFs.

Or should I just put the slipons with the stock map and go?<br><br>What is this RESET ECU stuff I read about?

This bike doesn't lend to "just taking it a little easier" on the street vs. track.<br>If you consider yourself a competent racer, you will quickly see what I mean.<br>The triple is mandatory, IMO, as I have said here ad nauseum. The clevis thing for the shock is needed only because of the raising the front with the Nichols triple. The good news is that with your weight, the stock springs should be good. I was just getting to where I was out riding the shock. Perhaps if you have Elka builds a shock for you, you can have them make it longer so you won't need the clevis? The SDs don't use a link so the shock set up is odd for a modern race bike.<br>I have posted my "to do" list before but here it is in short:<br>1. Slip ons- Akras and Leos are the finest products available due to their construction techniques. I have the Leo carbon cans. Lost something like 14 to 18 lbs, up high, where it counts.<br>2. 520 chain and aluminium sprocket. 4 or more pounds loss.<br>3. Suter slipper clutch<br>4. Shorai or similar Li Fe batteries. Stock battery= 3.9 kilos Shorai= 560 GRAMS!!!<br><br>If you are tracking it, you will be wound out all the time so the MH butterflies may not be needed?<br>I didn't list the Nichols parts because I have made it clear how I feel about it.<br>I love the MH box and highly recommend it as well. As you know, you HAVE to re-map after the intake/exhaust mods.<br>Seems TuneECU is the way to go and how I will handle mapping in the future.<br>Stay in touch here and keep up the queries!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/tyler.svg" alt=tyler> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">tyler</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-06 17:22:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hey what do you mean by "their construction techniques?"<br><br>I have always heard Akra and LV make really quality parts, but not sure why I always hear that.<br><br>I do know I can get titanium LeoVince slip-ons from their website for $650 which sure seems like a great deal to me... then I can get a TuneECU and maybe another air filter for now.
