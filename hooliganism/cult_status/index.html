Actually have SDs of one model or another?<br>Many of the other forums are filled with "Wanabes".<br>This Forum has been active since 2005. KTM are still but a "Small fish" in the roadbike scenario.<br>The original emphasis on "Out there" advertising has changed.<br>The Japanese and "Ducati" . Still have it. Even though their sales are down.<br>The Sales market. Still favours them. <br>Plus the fact that they have an already solid Sales infrastructure.<br>KTM. Were in the bussness of selling "Offroad" bikes. Their forays into "Road Bikes". Were welcome by such a few prospective "Roadbike" buyers.<br>It is hardly surprising that so few bought them.<br>The only "Worldwide" advertising. Was within the 125 Moto GP scene.<br>Noone outside was aware of that.<br>The SD had made its European debut in 2005 and was a bike with an unknown "V" twin configuration.<br>Aprillia had tried and failed on the WWM. previously(Due to under exposure. New fish in big pond).<br>The SD. Is a great bike. But it is not revolutionary. The one thing that KTM were hanging onto was the idea that "This was what Bikers" wanted.<br>They tried optomising their engines by including an underdeveloped fuel injection system. With the hope that trials/feedback, with such would allow them to smooth things out and enable the "Global launch."<br>Unfortunatly. Due to various legislations in countries accross the Globe.<br>The idea of "A Hooligan bike"(Check the original ADs. out?)<br>Could not be feasable.<br>By the time KTM had launched the Superduke on the "World market" . They had to "Dumb it down". With the SDR launched as the bike recognised as the "Limited edition" bike that would satisfy those that had been following the progress of the SD but were unable to by the Original.<br>The "Original SDs and The Ltd SDRs are considered "Cult Bikes". Only by those who have heard of them. But were to scared to take the plunge to buy them, due to the unknown infrastructure within their market boundaries.<br>You are a "Sheep" or a "Wolf"?<br><br>KTM are/were. Wolfs. Who want to wear sheeps clothing.<br>That is Global sales for you? <br><br>It is no surprise. That the most expensive bike on the KTM brochure is the SMR. Everyone knows that that is what KTM can do.<br>Best bike is the SMT. Because it is "All things to all men".<br>SDs are in a wide field.<br>SDRs are Neither here nor there. <br>They cannot compete with sportsbikes on track and they are too hard for the road.<br>Only cult because nobody buys them?

going for the same price. the Hawk was cool because it had a aluminium (or aluminium for you english dudes) frame and the single sided swing arm which was very cool to me then. in the end i did what i
