To keep a bike for 12 months... <br>2. To do more socialising and more trackdays.<br><br>Obviously i failed point 1... Owning 3 bikes in 2012.<br>Point 2 though i did well, i did a few social rides, several trackdays <br><br>2013 : So that for me is again point 1.<br>Keep a bike for 12 months.<br><br>Other goals/plans are a Germany/Spa tour and trackday. REALLY looking forward to riding Spa. I should have done it about 5 years back but due to leaky fork seal i pulled out when we were there. So this year it's a big one to tick off the list.<br><br>I'm planning on Donny and Cadwell next year to go along with Spa date, possibly a Pembrey weekend.<br><br>I also want to do a weekend riding in Wales<br><br>Lastly, i want to do an off-road school.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DucatiPete.svg" alt="Ducati Pete"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Ducati Pete</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-12-16 20:07:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I only rode my bike at 2 events last year.<br><br>Half day at Lydden Hill, and the Spanish crashfest.<br><br>I have to say, the company in Spain made the trip rather than the riding.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/lawman.svg" alt=lawman> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">lawman</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-12-16 20:11:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I didn't set any for 2012, but noteable events were Crashfest and nipping up the West Coast of Scotland on the SD.<br><br>For 2013<br><br>1.

Left by myself to contemplate the last year over a bottle of wine and packet of illicit fags that I'm meant to have given up.<br><br>This year's been the worst biking year I've got on record since I started riding when I was 14. Not the fault of anything other than the result of having new twin babies on top of a three year old, running a growing, energy sapping, high stress design company and moving into a money-pit house that needs a lot of work doing to it. <br><br>This year I've managed to get in only two track days and I can count the number of decent Sunday rides on one hand. The summer blizzed by with the house move without me even trying to get out much and as autumn came along the demands on my time meant that even going out to fiddle with the bike became rare. The bike has suffered. Most of the battery problems are because I don't fire up the SD enough and actually ride it and I'm experiencing for the first time what happens when you don't actually use a bike - it starts to go wrong and when you do use it there are problems that seem to come that wouldn't have otherwise. I used to spend hours cleaning and messing about with my bikes, it's the time you find the problems and keep on top of them. But now it just sits in the garage getting lonely and neglected. Went out today to find it covered in condensation and damp and there's rust starting to form on parts that were perfect before. Breaks my heart. fook English winters with the cold and moisture, they're a bastard!! I'd have the SD in central heating if I could!!<br><br>I open the cupboard sometimes - where all my bike gear is. Dainese leathers, Arai, Daytona boots,etc. The smell of the leather and shit, it makes me want to weep. I just want to put it on. Once when I was drunk I did that, just put the kit on to see what it felt like. How sad is that!! Kitted up but no way to actually go out and ride.<br><br>Had to re-insure last week as policy had run out. I'm broke with the house move and everything but I have to keep on being legally insured so I can ride I can. Lucky I'm so fooking old and what not:lol: Only a couple of hundred quid so I'm still to go if the opportunity arrises.<br><br>Anyway, I see it as a moment in time. It's just not a good time to be saying to Amy about going out for hours at a time or taking days off work for track days. Little kids are very time consuming, 21 month old twins and a three year old take just about every single minute you have to look after, believe me. Those with kids will appreciate what I'm saying.<br><br>One day, maybe in2013 I will get some time for me and the SD back. Hope so. Maybe 2014 <br><br>But my main goal of 2013 is to have to not sell the SD and all the accumulated kit and parts and shit for funds to live on. Please let me get through this time with the bike and gear intact!!!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Hotbrakes.svg" alt=Hotbrakes> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Hotbrakes</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-12-16 22:01:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>TBH Bic, you're lucky you're not in Jail for crimes against good taste.<br><br>I'd consider your continued freedom a real result and cherish 2012 for that.<br><br> </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-12-16 23:04:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>2012 wasn't too bad. Married my favorite riding buddy, did a decent amount of coaching, rode three new tracks (free), and dropped two seconds off my lap times...in the wrong direction. Didn't have much time for racing anyway what with working shifts every weekend. Went to first Moto GP race along with touring the Northeast US. Oh, and picked up a SDR cheap with low miles.<br><br>Next year...probably not racing, hopefully will have enough time off to do some coaching and trackdays, and at least justify keeping the race bikes around. Also taking a month off to tour the US for our honeymoon unless she gets a new better job and sets herself up to be my sugar momma. I'll also need to work on setting up the SDR with goodies and sponsors to race Pikes Peak in 2014. And of course enough time to enjoy and keep the ol' SD running. Looks like she'll be bringing in the new year dirty, cords showing, oil leaking, and in pieces. Rode hard and put away wet...minus oil that I drained and didn't have time to put back in.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-12-16 23:43:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/jmann.svg" alt=jmann> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">jmann</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-12-17 01:17:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I set no goals for motorcycling related activity in 2012.<br>well not goals persay, but events.<br>Utah for Superbikes, Laguna for GP, and rides to work and back through beautiful Ca. countryside.<br>I have failed misrably with the SD.

Next year I've just got to man up!<br><br>Main things I'm looking forward to are Cadwell Crashfest, hopefully a European Crashfest in October/November and getting back to Oulton Park. Need to get as much track action in as possible before possible family takes all my disposable income! <br><br>2012 has been a funny year really. Only got out on the bike twice on the road all year, once for service and once to see my Dad. Was getting more and more frustrated with road-riding.<br><br>Every single track event I went on was affected by rain in some way or another, this got frustrating so bought some wets. What a revelation! Managed to get my left knee down for the first time in the wet at Snetterton. Mental.. Managed to knock a few seconds off my laptimes as I gelled with the RC8 so that was good too. <br><br>Track year ended with a high speed drop at Silverstone. This made up my mind for me that Track riding is the only way for me now, if I came off at that speed on the road I wouldn't be here typing. Save for a couple very badly bruised ribs I'm fine.<br><br>Bike is now nearly rebuilt to track spec, I'll sort a rebuild thread when I have a spare hour.<br><br>In short this year the weather was shite, got my left knee down, missed out on Spanish crashfest, crashed and rebuilt bike. Full of ups and downs.<br><br>2013 will be better...</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/CEREC1.svg" alt=CEREC1> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">CEREC1</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-12-17 20:37:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Linga.svg" alt=Linga> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Linga</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-12-17 22:00:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Crotchrockety.svg" alt=Crotchrockety> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Crotchrockety</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-12-18 02:39:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/No47.svg" alt="No. 47"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">No. 47</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-12-18 20:34:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>2012 Goals: Ride my ass off. Did it. Started in Feb with a street ride 800 miles south to meet with my riding buds who hauled our dirt bikes south of Death Valley to the Jaw Bone off road area. Road our local dirt bike riding area untill it closed for fire danger. Road Dual sport events and brought home some trophys and prizes. Put my car in the garage and road bikes to/from work with special rides on the weekends plus some week nights. Was holding off for the new Adventure to sell so I could pick up some rich kids old unused Adventure, but picked up a good 950 KTM Adventure and road the heck out of it. Another goal was to up date my stock SD cause it's a keeper. Got some Akro cans, solo seat, new map , lost the can in the ass.<br>Got a comment from my gal which still makes me think: "You riding motorbikes is more than a hobby" Happy Hangover</span></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/shadowman.svg" alt=shadowman> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">shadowman</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-12-18 22:19:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>2012 has been somewhat disappointing. I sold the SD and bought an S1000RR. The day before my first and only track day of the year, I learned my bike was subject to a recall. Not a big deal mind you, only that it could grenade if ridden at higher temps or RPMs. It was supposedly fine unless ridden at the track. Doh.<br><br>Then there were other issues, like stalling while riding it in heavy traffic at 80 mph. (LA drivers are so courteous and move right out of your way when you have you flashers on.)<br><br>I had bought the S1000RR with the intention of doing more track days. That never happened. <br><br>For next year, I'm not making any plans. I was planning on attending the Texas MotoGP, but I really don't think that is going to happen. At this point, I'm still hoping the Myans were on to something and I never see 12/22/12.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SPEIRMOOR.svg" alt=SPEIRMOOR> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SPEIRMOOR</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-12-19 10:01:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SDNerd.svg" alt=SDNerd> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SDNerd</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-12-20 21:09:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
