It looks to me that this is just a test mule . That tank looks so out of place. What's with that low seat and the lack of ground clearance. <br><br>Thats probably why i love riding the superduke so much as its the most compact bike i have ever owned.<br>I don't believe that we will get a new SuperDuke that looks that dis-proportionate. I've never really been a single sided swing arm fan. Like many of you have said, it just adds weight. <br><br>This has to be a hooligan bike! That's what we all want. I think if we wanted something tame and watered down we'd be riding something like a Vstrom. Tail tidy can me made, exhausts can be changed, but a good base and ease of use is what KTM must provide to begin with. <br><br>That photo just reinforces my desire to keep my current SuperDuke as long as I live.

In a certain sense I think the 1300cc SD defines a somewhat new niche in motorcycling.......the "Muscle-Fighter". If they kept the weight in the 450lbs fully fueled range this could be a very fun bike no doubt about it. I agree with those who have pointed out that the seat tank juncture looks a little odd, kind of like the low seat version of the BMW R1200R. Or maybe a Multistrada/Super Duke hybrid or something? Also, I don't find this version of the trellis frame to be as visually appealing as that of the current model but I'm sure it's probably a necessary evil to cope with the larger, more powerful engine. I'd sure like to see it with a chin piece too. For me that was so much a part of the current SD styling that they really need to include it on the new version. <br><br>One thing I'm concerned about though, can anyone tell what the tank is made of? So help me if it's still that wothless, ethanol deforming Acerbis PA6 nylon piece of trash I'll personally fly to Austria to make sure they fit the production version with something acceptable!</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Lowrance" alt=Lowrance> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Lowrance</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-02 02:46:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-02 02:46:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>I am thinking this might be closer to done than not.<br>I got on a bike at a show once and when I leaned over to a semi tuck play like I was getting out of the wind, I nearly hand the wind knocked out of me from the sternum crunch upon the misshaped tank. The SD comes close to sternum crunch and this new one looks like it would be perfect if you do not plan on breathing in while tucked.<br>We cannot see how collapsed the suspension is, so ride height is tuff to connect with a good feel.<br>Another poster stated that throwing more money at it to get it sorted is all the rage these days and he/she was sure that would fix exhaust and tail trouble. It seems to be the norm these dayz. I will state that there was nothing wrong with the tail of the SD or the exhaust as far as looks go. I am very tainted here as far as a fair analysis, I doubt that KTM could have built anything that would have shook me into needing a replacement.<br>There was a recent post of what a Touno could have come out looking like that moved me and even Honda's new naked hits the mark better than what I see here.<br>The SD was love at first sight like my RD 350, all others were fun looking enough to hang out in a stall.

The only bikes they really had to compete against back then were the Monster and Tuono and they determined they could do that with a bike based on the Adventure. They went this way because it was the quickest and most cost effective way to get into the segment. They managed to build a surprisingly good bike, great in the eyes of many (myself included). They acheived performance and handling equal to or better than the competition of the day.<br><br>It's almost 10 years later, the competition has moved on substantially and by basing their naked bikes on sportbikes have set the bar much higher. I don't see how a naked sportbike based on the Adventure will be able to compete at this new level (I hope I'm wrong).<br><br>KTM could have erased all speculation and doubt by simply basing the new SD on the RC8R. You'd have the best frame, suspension with a proper rising rate linkage (and ride height adjustable), chassis and riding position adjustability, great motor, etc. etc. And ...a great looking bike to boot (see below)! Would be relatively cheap to accomplish as well (R&amp;D already done).<br><br>Instead, they give us this? While the obvious styling cues are akin to the original SD the overall shape (peg/bar/seat/tank relationship) is not naked sportbike. It appears to be a cross between a naked streetbike and a sit in cruiser (forward foot controls, good one!). SS swingarm?

I'll wait until the production version arrives, the mags start testing it, and I test ride one one before I start to panic that KTM has ruined the Super Duke. At this point all I've seen is a pre-production bike strapped to a trailer with tiedowns and people have already declared that the next SD is going to be some kind of cruiser. Also, yes they could have stripped down an RC8R and thrown Duke badges on it and called it a day but the SD was never a true naked sports bike. To me that's always what made it a better road bike than some of its competitors. If all I wanted was a sportbike with a more comfortable riding position I'd go buy a CBR1000R and replace the clip-ons with an LSR handlebar and be done with it. In the end everyon's concerns about the bike they see in the spy shot may be founded but to declare based on one picture that the new bike will be an ill-handling, overweight pig is a bit premature don't you think?</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Stratkat" alt=Stratkat> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Stratkat</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-03 12:02:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-03 12:02:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>I was quite pleased to see that.<br><br>It looks that they won't go the easy route to undress the rc8 but doing a proper naked from scratch but looking to what was well done with the current SD/SDR.<br><br>I believ it needs a loot of work, but it's going to be ok </div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Lowrance" alt=Lowrance> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Lowrance</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-03 13:52:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-03 13:52:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Zenbiker" alt=Zenbiker> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Zenbiker</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-03 15:32:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-03 15:32:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Jody" alt=Jody> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Jody</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-03 16:09:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-03 16:09:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>I haven't read through this whole thread yet, and I can't answer the poll because it lacks the option "Hmmm.

I apologize to those who continue to passionately tell me why the new bike won't be any good based on the photo of this pre-production bike. Why again must the new SD be derived from a sport bike to make for a worthy successor to the current model? How is the bike in the picture comparable to a Diavel? Does an extra 90 to 100cc's more than the RC8R push the new SD into the cruiser category whereas if they had kept it at 1200 it would have been nimble and sporty? To be honest, I couldn't care less if the SD evolved from adventure bikes and super moto's as opposed to a proper sport bike, the design just plain works for the street. I honestly do not care if the Tuono or Streetfighter are faster around a track because they are derived from sport bikes. I could name a lot of dedicated racer reps that are more capable track bikes than either of those bikes. So what? The SD is a great street bike that can be taken to the track if you want but nothing in the naked bike class can compete with an inexpensive Japanese litre bike on the track (assuming riders of equal skill). And the comparison to the CB1000 just downright silly. The new SD should have 40+ rear wheel horsepower on that thing and how much do you want to bet they will be similar in weight? The CB is no flyweight after all. <br><br>I also find it fun speculating and talking to you guys about the new model but it really it is just speculation at this point.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Lowrance" alt=Lowrance> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Lowrance</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-04 03:53:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-04 03:53:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>All this reminds me of when the first shots of the Ducati 999 appeared in the press </div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Lowrance" alt=Lowrance> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Lowrance</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-04 05:04:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-04 05:04:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Ok, one more. <br><br>Inexpensive Japanese litre bikes?

We're getting too old to fold ourselves into pretzels to ride the latest race reps on the street or track. I still want all of the performance without a weekly visit to the chiropractor. Most of the European manufacturers have started figureing this out. I'm still waiting on the Japs to get a clue but they keep feeding us these POS neutered nakeds presumably to prevent impacting their sportbike sales.

But based on what I've seen I do not have high hopes. The other bikes/manufacturers I mentioned previously have used the right formula to achieve what most of us ex racer/sportbike riders are looking for. The new KTM, by using the same formula they did at the begining of the last decade, does not look like it will meet my and many others needs.

One is that they are true motorcycle enthusiasts and their bikes are well thought out, designed by people who think about what 'riders' want. OK this comes out as "ready to race" which, (as has been pointed out here), is a bit of a marketing slogan and not absolutely true - but it does capture the essence in which they try and develop their bikes. The other important factor is that they are a small, Austrian company who have had to compete against the huge resources of the big Japanese four, the Italian lot, Triumph and that German company. They've done really well in the last decade because they've come up with some gems of bikes, (from Supermotos, adventure bikes, and now learner bikes, not to mention their core skill around off road machines. Paris Dakar anyone?), that deliver and appeal to a small but growing number of discerning customers. <br><br>You guys, are all part of this small, but appreciative group of people who are already KTM converts. Me too. I'll always be one of them - and am proud to be loyal to a company I spotted and started supporting a long, long time ago.<br><br>But when you are a growing company that has ambitions to be bigger and a global force things change. You have to get more money and maybe get some backing - so they join forces with an Indian giant who can inject more capital and potential into the business. You start to look for other ways to grow your business - and that includes the learner market, the massive opportunities in commuter bikes, and crucially appealing to the masses - not just guys like us.<br><br>And when you're a marketing led company, (which they undoubtably now are), they have to ask people what they want. And that means market research, testing, listening to the potential target market. Trying out ideas and concepts and showing people what they might do. OK they're not asking me and you direct. We are too small a niche group. It's not that they don't care, they know we are fans, they know we will be looking at their next product whatever they do. They want to connect with the thousands and thousands of people out there who DON'T know what a KTM is. Who DON'T want a hard styled, all or nothing bike, who want an exciting, but maybe less challenging concept of a bike to own.<br><br>Lets face it. The majority of bikers and potential customers out there are NOT YOU GUYS!<br><br>So, in my opinion the next SD will be everything a KTM should be. They will give the market what they need to do to be successful. As you guys have pointed out, they know what they are up against. They will deliver a package that has a competitive BHP output. They will ensure it handles brilliantly on road and track because that is what they know it will be judged against. They will make sure that it generates rave reviews however it is tested - they have an excellent track record of achieving this - don't doubt them now.<br><br>But it will also be styled and executed in a way that is designed to appeal to a much broader market. It will, maybe, appear to be 'less hard'. It may be less uncompromised. It may look less aggressive and have a few things which we all feel make it a 'softer, dumbed down option". But this will be because it was designed to sell to a broader market. <br><br>And we can get hold of it and do our thing to it. Strip off the SAS, junk the huge silencers and CAT. Fit race rear sets and take off the safety features and ABS. etc. etc. MAKE IT LOOK MORE AGRESSIVE. Change the ride height. Isn't this what we've always done to our bikes anyway. fook, in the 70's the bikes that came out of Japan were NOWHERE near what we wanted. You had to change EVERYTHING.<br><br>You guys seem to want everything done for you.<br><br>This bike will be a HUGE advancement on the current design we all ride and love. It will be a BETTER BIKE. KTM have NEVER designed a shit bike to my knowledge. But they could easily design bike that was aimed at a mass market and looked shit, (started with the Duke and LC4 already). But I've been converting them for over thirty years in to the bikes I really want to own.<br><br>I just intend to continue to do so.<br><br>Rant over.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=DucatiPete" alt="Ducati Pete"> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Ducati Pete</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-04 19:31:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-04 19:31:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=SDNerd" alt=SDNerd> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">SDNerd</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-04 20:12:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-04 20:12:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Stratkat" alt=Stratkat> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Stratkat</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-04 20:14:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-04 20:14:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=ColonelKlinck" alt=Colonel_Klinck> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Colonel_Klinck</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-04 20:23:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-04 20:23:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Yes but fuel has changed a lot over the last 10 years. Now we have the miracle additive Ethanol that gives lower mileage, deforms nylon tanks and drives up corn prices. I guess what I should have said was I'm surprised Aprilia didn't update their new models with a tank material that is impervious to Ethanol. Ducati's latest models have been equipped with either polyethylene (as on the Monster Evo and Diavel) or aluminium (Panigale). The Streetfighter was the last model to get the old style polyamide tanks and they are deforming at a hgh rate......see the poll they have going on the Streetfighter forum of the % of guys whose tanks are deforming. I believe it's more than half. Hopefully, KTM will do the right thing and skip the nylon junk and use something more appropriate considering the current state of US fuels.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Blackduke77" alt=Blackduke77> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Blackduke77</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-04 20:37:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-04 20:37:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>[quote="bic_bicknell"]Being in the business of product development and, more crucially, marketing I have to put in my opinion here in response to the posts on this thread - which I find a bit hysterical really.<br><br> OK this comes out as "ready to race" which, (as has been pointed out here), is a bit of a marketing slogan and not absolutely true - but it does capture the essence in which they try and develop their bikes.<br><br>its partially marketing but also has some truth behind it. no one really has a bike you can race out of the box. but it doesnt take a lot of prep work to make their off road bikes highly competitive.<br>then, as mentioned, there is Dakar, i believe when they were allowed to run the LC4 at Dakar, you could actually buy a full bore factory prepped machine from them.<br>also their arent a lot of companies who offer motorcycles with full slicks and no street legal amenities at all (ok Ducati used to). thats pretty close to race ready in my book.<br>in fact i myself bought a 525 with slicks (i did have them put street tyres on it when i picked it up...) right off the floor that i technically shouldnt have been able to register! </div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Willh" alt=Willh> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Willh</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-04 21:23:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-04 21:23:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=browser" alt=browser> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">browser</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-04 23:54:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-04 23:54:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Wow ,This has become one hell of a thread. I feel KTM wants to the right thing but they have to sell bikes All the left over dukes I'm sure put a dent in the bottom line.<br>I am sure they don't want to do that again. Being in the business I understand how things work.The dealers must go to the yearly meeting and read their crystal ball.They have order what they think they can sell.<br><br>Here is the problem lets say you see a winner you want to order 50 but to get 50 you have take a few dogs as well.<br>Also it depends on your numbers from last year. The MFG will only give you so many even if you know you could sell more.It's sucks here you have a bike that you could sell 30units and they will send you 5 units.<br><br>Aprilia is the worst for that. I have owned ape's I hear people in the US saying they want to buy an ape.I say where you going to go?<br>Please name a dealer.I was at Pro Itaila which is a big Ducati shop and aprilia They had no apes in stock but had a ton of ducks.<br>If you want order the rsv4 you will have to buy shivers DD's etc maybe for every RSV4 you must buy 5 of a bike that you know won't sell.<br>The Japanese have been doing this for years.<br><br>Every mfg does it differant I hear Ducati is good the lets you buy what sells.Now back to KTM why are there no RC8R 2012 in the shops? Not even SMT's<br>Someone said no MFG make a race ready race bike.I disagree The track RC8 R Track bike is ready to go even comes with all the go fast goodies and slicks.<br>This bike can not be ridden on the street period.Race it or track it.I see them on cycle trader but I can not see them in dealers shops.<br>Inventory is very low on KTM's Bottom line Dealers are afraid to stock too many 20k's bikes.<br><br>Then comes getting these bikes worked on.With aprilia the techs did not have proper training on these new bikes with all the gadgets.<br>Trust me I went to 4 had to sell it. KTM I am a little bummed I am having trouble finding a dealer that knows the RC8 and this bike is not that crazy with gadgets. The dealers don't want to spend the money to send their tech to KTM schools.This I know for a fact I have talked to the tech at differant shops.<br><br>The more stuff they put on these bikes the tougher it will be to get them worked on. I thinking BMW are the ony dealers that seem to have the right idea.<br>I have several BMW dealers that buy from me.They get sent to training all the time.KTM dealers need to get on the ball and know what they sell.If you have a dirtbike they know it. <br>Have an RC8 and your rolling the dice.<br><br>So if KTM is going to make a new amazing duke.I hope they do I would love to see it.How much will it be? How many will they send to the USA?<br>Will the dealers order them.The RC8 is amazing and they are tough to find. What about all the left over 08's<br>So many questions I know I can not afford to buy a 18k duke.I will buy the bike when they lower the price to half because only a few got sold.Or they will only send a few so they sell all the send. then they can get full price and be happy. <br><br>How many people bought dukes at full price only to see them sell for half a year later.I know I would be pissed.<br>This happed to me on a Honda in the 80's Now the Japanese don't send a ton of bikes any more In fact they make less than demand and that keeps the price up.Sure you get a discount. Then get ripped on dealer prep etc.<br><br>The motorcycle business has changed.I will be at the Dealer expo this month. Any mfg worth there salt will be there I will dig for all the info I can on this new duke. KTM will be there so will Aprilia I know this tread has made me think.I want to know so if I can get some answers from the horses mouth I will.<br><br>I will do my best to find out and get back to you guys.<br>Mean while know that our dukes are still amazing It's hard not to fall in love with this bike.They still handle like a sportbike you don't have to have a perfect track to go fast this is what make a true classic Ride it anywhere on anything it love it.I ride on roads that are pure crap The duke never complaines it just goes.

Wow really hot in here. You think its hot in here? Maybe its just me. Maybe its just my age or something...<br><br>I'm basically with BIC on this one. KTM will release a bike that will attract new customers AND keep the faithful happy. I'm optimistic.<br><br>My take on that picture is that it shows some things that are nearly finished (Eg the engine) and other things that will do for testing. In terms of styling I think we are seeing bits and pieces of the various options that have been tried and sometimes adopted and sometimes rejected. That's why the styling is basically KTM but is also why the whole thing doesn't have that "integrated" feel. That swing arm looks very much a prototype. Could end up in production but could also be dropped. <br><br>If one looks at the individual bits I believe certain conclusions can be reached. That seat arrangement for example, shows that they are fooling around with something that gets around the problem of the "R" seat without having a twin seat as per the 2012 R. Now the illustrated solution is nothing new but it indicates that they are working on options. The rear end is the same - track-like rear end with a fuck-ugly plate carrier bolted on. Tank shrouds don't match the tank. In fact, they have a horizontal line that is more in keeping with the Venom.<br><br>Overall, my feeling is that what we are seeing is a mule that uses bits and pieces out of the parts bin. Based on those parts the next bike could replace both the RC8 AND the Superduke. It could be the same bike with clothes either on or off which makes sense from a manufacturing perspective. <br><br>If the production bike ends up anywhere like this I'm glad that they are exposing the engine a bit more (whats the point of a naked if it hasn't got a plunging neckline ). I also like to see throttle bodies but am wondering whether there is any airbox in there in this photo.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Blackduke77" alt=Blackduke77> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Blackduke77</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-07 03:16:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-07 03:16:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=JohnJJr" alt=JohnJJr> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">JohnJJr</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-07 03:23:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-07 03:23:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=darko" alt=darko> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">darko</h3> <time datetime="2012-02-10 01:47:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-02-10 01:47:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>I'll always take more power if its offered!!!
