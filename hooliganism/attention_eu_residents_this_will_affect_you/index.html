Basically they're suggesting:-<br><br>1- The Anti tampering Regulation: Specifically Article 18 which wants to stop all modifications to complete power train, from airbox to controlling the rear tyre profile. <br><br>2- Compulsory ABS. If we can't stop this, we must get a switch so that we have an option in difficult conditions where ABS doesn't function well. <br><br>3- Automatic headlights on- passing the blame for poor observation on to us. <br><br>4- OBD. On Board Diagnostics so that easy roadside checks can be made of our emissions and so that constant readouts of engine performance can be obtained. Expensive, complicated and with the threat, rather like a tacho, of identifying past riding style... <br><br>5- RMI. Repair and Maintenance Information. Rather than keeping it hidden and available for huge expense, there is a chance that manufacturers will be forced to provide ECU codes etc for a fee. What that fee is remains to be seen. <br><br>6- The very worrying article 52: "If systems, components or seperate technical units on a list in a delegated act to this regulation, have a dual use, for vehicles intended exclusively for racing on roads and for vehicles intended for use on public roads, they may not be sold or offered for sale to consumers" <br><br>So if your K&amp;N filter can fit a CBR race bike and a CBR road bike, the best way to police that, is to make it illegal to sell the filter in Europe. <br><br>The Delegated Acts are the most scarey thing, as they are the lists and details drawn up by the unelected and we won't get to see what they are including until after the Regulation has been passed! <br><br>7- In solidarity with the French we will be drawing attention to their recent gov proposal to ban all bikes over 7 years old from an urban area and to make the wearing of day-glo/ reflective clothing compulsory. <br><br>8- Full sleeve day-glo clothing for riders and passengers has been proposed in the Irish Parliament too. <br><br>9- All these issues lead to the same thing, that we must take the blame for the incompetence of other road users. And while the emergency stop has been removed as a compulsory element of the car driving test, we are jumping through hoops with ill judged UK interpretation of EU licencing directives. <br><br>10- Another EU licencing Directive is on its way (3DLD) to step the bike licencing system still further and the DfT and DSA still haven't sorted even the consultation process, even though it is meant to be in law by now and enacted January 2013. <br><br>All we can do about it is sign this petititon <a class=postlink href="http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/5334">http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/5334</a><br>And write to your MEP and MP telling them it's very nice they're so concerned about us, but we'd rather they just left us alone.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-08-23 07:46:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>ffs leave us alone and worry about sorting the economy out you bunch of *****!!!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/blb.svg" alt=blb> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">blb</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-08-23 08:25:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TLSRuss.svg" alt=TLS_Russ> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TLS_Russ</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-08-23 08:34:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Signed up </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/shadowman.svg" alt=shadowman> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">shadowman</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-08-23 09:13:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>My understanding is that the powertrain modification will only apply to vehicles with a stated maximum power output. For example in the UK 125's and mopeds have a maximum allowed power and it's that type of bike that will not permit powertrain mods.<br><br>As for the rest my guess is that abs / TC will be fitted to everything fairly soon, if it's proven and available technology and manufacturers don't fit it then they will inevitably be sued by dead riders estates for reckless endangerment. Racing callipers will still be available as alternatives but I hear the Honda system on the latest blade is really good so we probably won't bother when the time comes.<br><br>I'm told the reflective clothing thing in France means they have to carry but not wear it. Not sure about this though. If it became compulsory in the UK I would either ignore it or just give up. Seems to me that despite our moans the UK is quite a liberal place and not given to this type of deterministic law so I doubt it will get implemented any time soon.<br><br>Our bigger problem is that new bike sales are in freefall and my guess is that the number of licensed riders is also decreasing as the average age of the riding population increases. This means down the line that less and less hardly ridden, good as new bikes for half the new price will be available. In the past I have snapped up modded Fireblades, Gixers, R1's and the like with just a few K on the clock for not much more than the first owners spent on mods. Those days may be over. If the number of bikes on the road falls below some critical mass then the infrastructure of dealers, accessory suppliers, tuners etc will start to decay and we will go from being barely a spec on the radar to completely irrelevant in the national consciousness. That’s the bigger picture IMO.<br><br>We spend far too much time fussing over tiny specky details when what we need is celebrity endorsements, bands on bikes, OK spreads of me and my bike, family bike related events, multi coloured enviro city bikes, boy bands on bikes, etc. Put a cutie on a Malaguti, make bikes cool again and secure the future or fuss over the fine detail and watch it vanish before our eyes. That’s the choice.<br><br>Now where were we.... Oh yes, EU bashing thats it.
