My first crash caused my "relay lever natural 07" to twist up. Managed to get the bike to shift decently, but it's not ideal. I've been waiting for a replacement for over 2 months. My second fall bent the clutch-side mirror bracket. I'll also likely have to wait a few weeks to get this imported/shipped in by KTM USA from what I've been told. Scratches on the tank panels and battery fairing, pricey to replace, haven't checked on trying to take it to bodyworker for repairs...<br><br>The bike crashes well alright, got the bike working and back on track by lunch for both days, but the aftermath is a pain.<br><br>I've only been riding 15 years and have fallen thrice, mostly accidental slips in parking lots and my garage.

I saw pictures of your bike and I can also see you have pride in ownership. A road racer friend of mine told me back in the 80's that if you can't aford the price or stomack to see your bike fall over in your garage you have no busness riding that bike on the track. I was starting to get my road race liceins back then, came in third my first novice race, and was board stiff wating for another round. I had to prep my 600R Ninja street bike, drag it 100 miles one way, and sit and watch others race till my turn. So I am sitting there watching my weekend burn away when I usually would be out riding the full day, getting home before dark. That was the end of that. I live in a special place that I love. I can make a 100 mile loop out my door without going thru one traffic light. You on the other hand live in the Bay Area I believe and my guess is it's at least 45 min riding to get up on HWY 1 or eq. So I can see the sasfety of a track for you.<br>The Suzuki SV would be a good bike to start on,it's not real fast...then move on to a 600 in line four. They are cheap and plentful un-like your cherry non-belly button SD. ( belly button bike = everyone has one) <br>If you want to really learn how a bike handles on the cheap, get down and dirty with a dirt bike.<br>Let the fire works start..... </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/cdlabate.svg" alt=cdlabate> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">cdlabate</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-14 03:40:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>@ Jermo, ur right, my 15 yrs of road riding has mostly just instilled in me the respect and danger for riding in traffic, but has really not added anything to my ability to ride fast.

We have hundreds of miles of backroad mountain twisties here with ever so changing road conditions-from chip seal, tar repairs, gravel, and debris on the less travel roads. Also not to mention all the 4 wheel drivers not aware of our existence. I had a guy with a blow horn scare the hell out of me yesterday because I passed him while splitting lanes in stopped traffic. I've done 3 trackdays on the SDR without incident, just to come home and have it fall over when trying to put it on a stand. Why not just let the Duke do double duty and use on both the street and track.

So many pros/cons of street/track riding, could be a thread in its own right. I'm sure there will be more falls in the future and if I had to pick my poison, I'd prefer to drop it in my garage or sub 60 mph into an open pasture (without all the cow pies). Being a big wuss on the street has kept me rubber side down for a while, should probably try to put that mentality towards my track riding too since the last 2 crashes were me getting a bit too exuberant (passing outside on an area of track riders rarely go, trying to cut too aggro a race line and slipping on the raised candy stripe).<br><br>cdlabate, virgins can SO be given orgasms </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/JohnJJr.svg" alt=JohnJJr> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">JohnJJr</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-15 04:58:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/cdlabate.svg" alt=cdlabate> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">cdlabate</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-15 05:02:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/JohnJJr.svg" alt=JohnJJr> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">JohnJJr</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-15 06:34:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/JohnJJr.svg" alt=JohnJJr> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">JohnJJr</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-15 07:20:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/JohnJJr.svg" alt=JohnJJr> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">JohnJJr</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-16 15:08:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>One of my favoret finds in Cali.... Not looking at the map at the moment, so for memory, North of San Fran on Hwy 1, go to Stewerts Point, then take the little road that heads inland. Its a small one lane for miles. It will eventually lead you to a water resevor dam. The road near this dam is to die for. Lots of elevation gain and loss. Nice corners. Frikin race track in the woods.<br>Yep, the dual sport bikes are a hoot, and cheap. Do some dual sport rides. Lot's of bang for the buck. Lot's of seat time. Hell of a lot of fun, and you get to keep your drivers licinse.<br> Over the weekend I thought you might want to pickup a spare SD for the track.

Invariably better to crash at the track, than on the street. And that's the best place to learn what 9+/10ths of a motorbike's performance limits are - NOT the street.<br><br>Hey Dribbler, you ever been to a track, let alone ridden on one? Kinda judgmental (and fascist) of you to suggest that only one opinion matters. Somewhat contrary to the purpose of a "forum". And you can spare me the intentionally misspelled, thinly veiled string of barely intelligible double (+) entendres. We all know you can bash out words in a straightforward manner.<br><br>While I agree with most of Mr. Hotbrakes remarks, I don't come away that he's qualified to write a book based on that single internet forum post. He appears to be affiliated with a trackday org (?), and clearly has no shortage of track time under his belt. If so, I am encouraged to read that there is at least one person affiliated with TrackTactics that isn't a total fooking moron. Must be better folks out east - because out here, if TrackTactics was the last trackday org there was, I still wouldn't roll with them. Rephrase: I'd prefer a purgatory of riding up and down the 405 a thousand or more times, than risk death doing a trackday with them. Maybe things have changed, but historically they had only clowns associated with their show. Very dangerous clowns.<br><br>So kudos to you Mr. Hotbrakes, for breaking the mold with some intelligent thoughts.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TLSRuss.svg" alt=TLS_Russ> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TLS_Russ</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-20 18:26:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Riding a bike is all about confidence not where or what you ride </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Linga.svg" alt=Linga> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Linga</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-20 19:07:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-20 23:54:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/PBRnr.svg" alt=PBRnr> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">PBRnr</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-24 00:52:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>thx for all the feedback and appreciate the votes of confidence. I'm definitely sticking out this season on the SD and am looking forward to getting back to sears pt, which I'm more familiar with.

Currently in the upper pace of B-/C depending on what company I track with.
