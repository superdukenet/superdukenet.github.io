Hate the bike.<br><br>Everybody knows the good.<br>Now the bad: the throttle response is atrocious at anything below 4k rpm.<br>From what I've read here, it's a "feature" of the bike, but strangely some seem worse than others.<br>Mine is bad.<br>Riding in town is an utter nightmare.<br>Riding behind a car, at say 20-25 mph, it has happened that the bike starts to sputter, like if I was constantly closing and opening the throttle rapidly. I have to pull the clutch. Very annoying. And embarrassing, to say the least.<br>I live on a small island, so avoiding residential areas is impossible.<br><br>But even riding through mountain roads, I have to keep the revs north of 4K, otherwise the throttle response is very abrupt, upsetting the bike.<br>Above 4K everything works perfectly and the bike is a dream.<br>But it makes spirited riding a real challenge, specially on tight roads, which is a real shame because the bike handles like a demon!<br>On really slow corners I don't even try to ride fast and lean the bike a lot, because if even in 2nd gear I can't get the revs higher than 4k, it's just not worth it and, quite honestly, somewhat dangerous.<br><br>As a first step, I am considering a pair of slip-ons an a K&amp;N filter to see if things improve, as well as adding a nice sound, of course.<br>The noise of a superduke with standard exhaust is just wrong... <br><br>I am considering the FMF or the Mivv suono full carbon, as aesthetically, they are, to my eyes, the most pleasing.<br>I can get the FMF in my country (Portugal) for 1k€ or the Mivv from Italy for 910€.<br>I am more inclined towards the Mivv, since I think they look better, though I can't buy them locally, which I would prefer.<br><br>Also, there are no tuners on my island, so fine-tuning the fuel injection can be very tricky.<br>I was also considering a powercommander, but I can't tune it on a dyno because there aren't any here.<br>Money is tight right now, so I don't know if by just using a standard map thing will improve a lot or not. Given the money (here a PC is expensive), I don't know it it's worth it or not.<br><br>How about the catalytic converter? Where is it?<br>By just installing the mentioned slip-ons will I get rid of it?<br>I ask because I previsouly owned a MV Agusta F4 312R and just by removing the cat the throttle improved slightly (and the bike ran MUCH cooler).<br><br>BTW, I have been searching but it's hard to find pics of the R version with the Mivv Suono full carbon.<br>Where can I find pics of it?<br>Thanks in advance.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Linga.svg" alt=Linga> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Linga</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-03-14 15:35:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>This should have all you need for next to nothing<br><br>You should get away with spending nothing on fuel modules for a while mate</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-03-14 16:02:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I think you might have something wrong with your bike and I would sort it out before making modifications.

I still would look for the simple things that make this bike a PITA to ride. I have way more faith in KTM to supply a bike, as expensive as it is, not to be ridable. I can see a throtle cable not set up correct from the dealer. But all the other modifications? With that said, I do believe the mods might make it better, but I don't have that experience. My SD is still stock. All I am trying to say is make dang sure you are starting with the bike set up as it is intended from the factory as the KTM designers intended before you start chasing your tail. Rat holes can run deep. If you have to take your bike back in for service, after you made all the mods, what do you think will happen then? My guess is they will through thier hands up in the air.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MrZ32.svg" alt=MrZ32> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">MrZ32</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-03-16 16:03:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>the cause of this jerky behavior of the sd and sdr is the fuel injection control loop, that uses the O2 value of the sensors<br>all thanks to environmental laws.<br><br>the problem is the O2 sensors don't work properly under 4000 rpm ! </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/One67.svg" alt=One67> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">One67</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-03-16 16:18:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I disagree. <br><br>Closed loop FI is common for motors at low throttle and well discussed here and many other bike forums.

First off the SDR up to 2010 has known issues with sensor getting out of calibration. This problem can be fixed by having your dealer recalibrate them. I've done it and it works to some degree. And another added plus to taking in to the dealer is they will update software and maps if and when there availible. The cost for me to do this was about $120 US dollars. And the dealer said it should be done at least once a year. I don't neasarly agree with having to do this. But it did make the bike smoother at lower rpm. What it did not cure is the sensitive throttle. Why? Read the next paragraph below.<br><br>When Ktm designed the SD they wanted a motor that would have the torque of a V-twin but rev quickley like a inline four. To do this I believe they used a lighter flywheel for less mass. Sort of like a MX bike vs a Endural bike the later with a heaver flywheel(Smoother). This worked ok for the standard SD. But when they came out with SDR they lighteened the crank as well. This made the throttle even more sensitive. The RC8 had the same issues up to 2010. In 2011 they fixed it with a heaver flywheel and better electronics. Some say it took a little bit of the Horse power away. I test road the 2012 RC8 down my local twisty road, Mines Rd. in Livermore Ca. All I can say is What a differants it made. With the heaver flywheel it is smooth as a inline four now. Now granted this is not the same motor as the 990, it's a 1190. But the 1190 had the same issues up to 2010 and in 2011 they fixed it.<br><br>The SDR is a rare bike to have. After test riding the RC8 I was contemplating about trading in my 08 SDR. But I just can't find it in my self to let the SDR go. It's got way to much character </div></p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
