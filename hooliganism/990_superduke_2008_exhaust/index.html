It seems to me that you can hardly go wrong at the price they are looking for. I removed the dead weight off of my original SuperDuke and installed Graves exhaust which at the time was purely experimental exhaust. There were a few that got into the SD exhaust aftermarket equation. Leo Vince, Mivv, Yoshimura, Graves, and a few more reputable exhaust makers. I honestly believe you cannot go wrong as I am sure that they will supply a few more horses and the weight savings alone would be substantial improvement. The Y-pipe looks good the pipes look like they may be a bit short. I wonder if you contacted them if they have a picture they can post uo showing how they look. There is a set of used Slip on Akropovic's for $1000 and a full set of headers and cans with a make offer listing. I do not believe that you need more than slip ons and Y-pipe. Buy the set you linked us to and write up a review for us. Livermore Huh? I was born in Livermore. You work out at the lab?

I don't need anymore performance. at ~ 400bucks depending on which ebay deal you go for (some of them indicate ...made in Poland)... who cares.

I saw a picture (maybe on this forum) showing a 990 with a single can set up (kind of like a 1290). Lastly, if i could ream out, modify the existing stock exhaust... that would be great.

I ran Graves exhaust on my last SD and they were about as loud and obnoxious as a person had a right to run. That was cool when I was trying to keep up with the other orange and black colored motorcycles db coolness ratings. The super plus side was the lightening of the motorcycle. When and if you finally remove the stock exhaust you will be surprised how flipping heavy or is that hefty they are. You will soon change your mind as to which performance upgrade the switch out bested. <br>I now have the stock exhaust and love the sound just the way it is. If I were to modify my exhaust it would be to lesson weight only. this exhaust conundrum is in itself a hamster wheel race and I'm afraid it is a race to the bottom. Contact Remus exhaust. Look them up. I think that their North American headquarters is in Oakland. If you care at all to accessorize your steed in a manner befitting its heritage, you will fashion it in Akropovic exhaust. We need you to tow the company line. Austria is going through some tough political and financial times right now and it would behoove you to help them out. Red Bull, KTM, and Akropovic do not move outside this equation. If you must then Remus is Austrian and you'll be okay. <br>Many of my son's high school class mates graduated from Cal Poly.

I am sure i can search and eventually arrive at some conclusion... but always good to hear the latest analysis. <br><br>Did change the oil last week. Always feels better after buying something used ! Also, finally got to DMV to get legal (after 2 years being in CA with AZ license ! )... Lock me up !!! <br><br>I'll update when i finally figure the exhaust upgrade out... still on the fence on what to get. Seems not so much availability as compared to probably 10 years ago !?

Have been very temped to just order the "Dominator" from Poland and be done. Certainly helps to hear they actually fit up (even if bracket are flimsy). <br><br>However, i like the gpr black (or Mivv) for that matter, exhaust cans. So i will go a little longer with trying to get adequate info. <br><br>I'lll keep you posted where I land !?:<br><br>thx<br>steve</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Hefty2000" alt=Hefty2000> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Hefty2000</h3> <time datetime="2020-01-20 02:26:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2020-01-20 02:26:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Finally !! It only took almost 9 mo to pull the trigger... but alas. I went frugal... saved $$ over buying even used Akrapovic. I bought the Dominator . Transaction was so smooth. Ordered on ebay... delivered to my door in 7 days (shipping included). I figured for the price, the installation was going to be a nightmare. Not true. It probably took me ~ less than two hours... and most time was spent removing the old stock unit cat. and all. Haven't ridden yet, but started and rev'd. Definitely loud enough which is what i wanted. Also bought a simple tail tidy billet aluminium bracket set up, and some cheap mini turn signals. Got all installed. All good except turn signals don't work. I wonder if I have positive/power wire reversed? The turn signals are LED...so perhaps it makes a difference which direction the juice is flowing. The LED license plate light works good.<br><br><img src="https://oi957.photobucket.com/albums/ae54/stev064/ktm/IMG_20200119_154630_zpsfjlqgveu.jpg" alt=Image></div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=DribbleDuke" alt=DribbleDuke> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">DribbleDuke</h3> <time datetime="2020-01-21 00:35:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2020-01-21 00:35:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>cool<br>Don't forget to do the fifteen minute idle.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Hefty2000" alt=Hefty2000> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Hefty2000</h3> <time datetime="2020-01-21 04:39:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2020-01-21 04:39:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Dribble D....<br>? 15 min idle?
