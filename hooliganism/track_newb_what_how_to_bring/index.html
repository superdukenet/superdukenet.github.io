I could count on one hand the number of unridable bikes I saw (out of thousands taking part).

With oposing traffic, junctions and potholes you are in much more danger on the way to the track than you are when on it. You dont need to take anything special.

Reading through these answers to your question PBRnr makes me realise there are two trains of thought here. The first is what you should bring/prepare for. That's easily answered and I'm sure there will be much advice. Personally I think for your first few track days you should not get occupied with all the kit, tyre warmers, vans, track day accessories etc. Just get down there making sure that your bike is in good condition, tyres good, brake and other fluids checked, preferably an oil change - the regular pre-check routine.<br><br>The biggest issue you will face is your state of mind. Seriously, you will have butterflies the night before and will not sleep well. You need to arrive in plenty of time, give yourself a nice talk to to calm your nerves and set off determined to take it easy and be prepared to learn from scratch. Enter into the novice group with the confidence that you can ride your bike and don't get hung up on becoming a track day god on the first time out. You won't be. Just accept that you have a learning curve to go on. Don't be intimidated by all the other guys who have a lot of experience, don't envy their inters. and fast group wrist bands - you might be there one day but not today. Take it real easy, try and learn the track in the morning. Let everyone else pass you - it doesn't mean you are a wimp, it means you have a good understanding of your abilities. If you stay on and get to ride the next session - that's when you are doing well and are the hero of the day.<br><br>The "red mist". You might find that you speed up and start getting on a roll and are riding faster than you want. It sucks you in - believe me. That's when novices crash. They start to believe they are gods and start to ride at a pace they would not usually be comfortable doing. It's an ego thing. Don't let anyone tell you different, we've all done it to some extent. It is a horrible moment to suddenly realise you are crashing/running out of track space/entering a corner too fast and panicking/freezing. It happens in slow motion and you will relive it hundreds of times in the future as you replay your stupidity.<br><br>My advice is to really get your mind focussed on what your abilities are. Don't try and prove anything to anyone, except yourself. The feeling of improving and slowly getting to grips with track day riding is unbeatable when riding home after eight sessions round a great track is absolutely unforgettable and rewarding beyond your wildest dreams. But to go beyond your abilities on your first day, crashed bike, repair bills, maybe injuries leaves you feeling like a fool and maybe would even stop you having another go.<br><br>So go for it! <br><br>PS. I made ALL of the above mistakes. ALL OF THEM <br><br>So take my advice. I now ride in inters and sometimes fast. But the memories of my mistakes still haunt me, I learned the hard way.<br><br>Good luck.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=DavoSingapore" alt=Davo-Singapore> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Davo-Singapore</h3> <time datetime="2011-02-01 22:02:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-02-01 22:02:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Sabre" alt=Sabre> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Sabre</h3> <time datetime="2011-02-01 22:43:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-02-01 22:43:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Mate. If it's your first trackday just keep it simple. Ride up with a back pack or tank bag. If you can tow the bike that's also good. Take some good food, drinks etc. A small tool and puncture kit plus a tyre pressure gauge. The latter is most important. If you take nothing else, take the presure gauge. Get to the track in plenty of time and settle down and watch what's going on. Ask questions and get comfortable. Get on your bike and ride.

However, I went to an evening session at Brands with Shade and BTD and I just felt rubbish, no confidence at all on the brakes or in the corners so I decided I couldn't get any slower so it was as good a time as any to practice my body positioning and I ended up having so much fun in the end, I wasn't the quickest but I was getting it and then the next time I did a track day the whole thing was so much better and I improved considerably because of the time I spent learning that time out, if I'd carried on as I was Id have invariably done a BTD at clearways or somewhere similar.<br><br>So don't worry too much about riding you're bike there for your first couple of times, just take your time and get into it, make sure to take the time to warm your tyres, most of the novice crashes I've seen have been in the first session with people going too hard before their tyres are ready or before they've worked out the track a bit more.<br><br>We usually say 2-3 laps over here is enough, I always erred on the side of caution with tyre warming and always waited till the 3 laps were done before really opening her up but I was a bit slow compared to others so I've started picking the pace up gradually through the 3 laps so I'm full speed by the end of the 3rd</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=AgentOrange" alt="Agent Orange"> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Agent Orange</h3> <time datetime="2011-02-03 06:10:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-02-03 06:10:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Haha great to hear folks reminisce about track days past. I fully intend on being able to do the same one day, hopefully upon all positive experiences. I grew up put-putting along SF city roads on a small-cc cruiser and then cruised around on my father's old sport tourers. The SD is my first venture into sport riding and the fact that this bike was waaaay more capable than myself was glaringly obvious the moment I cracked that throttle. That said, I do feel the track would be the best way for me to learn the beasty in the safest way possible.<br><br>I already catch myself riding faster than I did in all my years previously, mostly because the SD puts out so easily...it's like falling asleep at the wheel (thankfully never FULLY happened to me); in the back of your mind you know you're going fast, but maybe you don't realise it until it's just too late to slow down. I've got my share of small, ego-grounding experiences in my riding history to know I'm no Moto God.

I never even considered the possibility of crashing. Thankfully, I didn't crash. <br><br>I've hauled the bike for each successive track day. Its less stressful. All the track day sponsors require a certain amount of bike prep: tape lights, tape or remove mirrors, remove fuses, etc. When you haul, you can do this stuff beforehand at that makes one less thing you have to do at the track. You can concentrate on the things like finding a place to camp out, registering, tech inspection, etc. Most of all, you'll have plenty of time to make sure you make the rider's orientation meeting. If you miss that, you're out.<br><br>The other advice I have is to take plenty of fluids. You need to stay sharp. It sounds stupid, but quit when you get tired. I personally don't ride the last session. I'm just too beat by then. <br><br>tyres: My first track experience was with Reg Pridmore and his CLASS school. Reg pretty much requires new tyres. With new tyres, I'm generally moving pretty good by the end of the second lap. By session 2, the tyres are smoking - literally. <br><br>I thought requiring new tyres was a bit anal, until my last track day at Fontana. It was a bit cold, and it had rained the night before. The track didn't look wet, but after three laps, I figured my tyres would be fine, so I uncorked it going down the front straight. When I hit the brakes the bike just started to slide, so I did my best to get it pointed in the right direction and held on for dear life as i ran over the two curbs at the end of the front straight. I kept the bike up, but probably wouldn't have had the problem at all on fresh tyres. The tyres I had on the bike were baked from my last trip to the track. So, consider fresh tyres. You don't need warmers with street tyres, but they definitely work better when fresh.<br><br>Perhaps the best advise I could give you is not my advice at all. Its from Jason Pridmore. Remember, this is not a race. There are no trophies or prize money. You are there to have fun and to improve your riding skills.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=PBRnr" alt=PBRnr> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">PBRnr</h3> <time datetime="2011-02-04 08:20:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-02-04 08:20:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>man, I love this no-BS thread! topnotch</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=drswade" alt=drswade> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">drswade</h3> <time datetime="2011-02-10 13:19:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-02-10 13:19:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=PBRnr" alt=PBRnr> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">PBRnr</h3> <time datetime="2011-02-10 18:36:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-02-10 18:36:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>WOW!

Those guys will end you! There were some seriously questionable lines being ridden all around you. I saw you having to ride into some scary areas of that track to avoid guys.<br>That guy that crashed at T1 did a C group type mistake: Guy in front parks in T1 and the guy from behind, who was drag racing out of 11, snatches the brakes and.....dump.<br>You did an outstanding job not following the bike off of the track...or did you?<br>It looks like cars were on the track the day before or so. Lots of oil and sweep on the track.<br>I rode there once just after NASCAR and man. was that track filthy!<br>It looked like you were riding the bike in the proper rev range. It took me ages to figure that out. As soon as I got a GoPro I figured out lots of things.<br>Keep at it and you will get faster.<br><br>It is weird to watch such slow laps around that track.<br>Before you think I am on a high horse, take a look at the humbling video of Martin Szwarc in the Formula Pacific race.<br><a class=postlink href="http://www.flipshare.com/api/template/lp/fb/viewreshare.html?id=8377FB7B-8991-46D3-9D10-BEB275BD8D7F">http://www.flipshare.com/api/template/l ...
