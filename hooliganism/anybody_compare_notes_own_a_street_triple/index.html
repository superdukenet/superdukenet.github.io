Actually, I currently own a SMR--but close enough to the Duke (owned a std. and R there as well). And as I do every couple years, contemplating a new bike.<br><br>The deal is the SMR needs shocks/forks gone through; base gaskets done; new clutch pack; and tranny gone through and polished/burnished to fix notchy shifting as miles crept on (at 18,000 now). The local suspension wizard (who sponsers AHRMA racing) says he can do ALL for $2,000-2,400. Or I can trade for 2011 SMR (maybe best wait for the 2012) for $6,600 on a 2011.<br><br>I really like the SMR and it is the only bike I have ever seen upset the ST R in a comparo (Performance Bikes maybe?).<br><br>Thoughts and opinions on those who have ridden or owned the little ST R. The thought of enough power and really light bikes is appealing.<br><br>And then there is the new Tuono...... But man, I think it is ugly--and WAY beyond my performance needs--is it really more FUN? But same price as a SMR!

A buddy bought the first stripleR that came into town, and I got to ride the piss out of that more than a few times in the twisty bits. Good fun. Such linear power - its like the throttle is a rheostat to an electric motor. Such a soft suspension ... so if you're not a big dude - good to go. Butt dyno told me that peak power (at the rear wheel) wasn't what the Daytona produces - I'm guessing like 95 rwhp. Makes good music at full song too, BTW.<br><br>Later, I had opportunity to flog an SD at a couple of different tracks (oh, yeah - on the street too), and I lost my mind and suddenly forgot that there was company called "Triumph" (even though I have one). <br><br>I was kind of 'meh' on the big bore S3 - heavy, soft - even the motor felt soft to me. Supposedly makes more power than the SD, but around town - the SD rules. All the torque in down low, slim chassis, quick turning, top shelf parts, stunning looks - sold!<br><br>Yeah, there were the Tuonos, Monsters, Brutales ... whatever ... If the Tuono was ever as handsome as a Brutale - and they just seem to get uglier with time - the SD might never had made it into the garage. No risk in that I suppose. I also don't need 130 to 160 HP to have a good time - especially on my everyday bike. <br><br>Anyway, I think least expensive route is to get your SMR sorted, flog that for another couple years, and then move on. But, I have to say that trade value would be pretty tempting.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MADDOG53.svg" alt=MADDOG53> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">MADDOG53</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-19 08:54:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I like the street triple's looks since they tucked the pipes under the seat. Gives it a more menacing look, but it still doesn't compare the SD. It seems to me that the SD has this perception as being an uncontrollable beast so people opt for a triple or Duc or something else. It's like the SD is that evil black horse everyone is afraid of riding. You would think the Brutale would be most feared, but it could be the sharp lines on the SD make people think it will cut them or bite them (which it will actually).</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/omky756.svg" alt=omky756> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">omky756</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-19 09:22:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DavoSingapore.svg" alt=Davo-Singapore> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Davo-Singapore</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-19 12:58:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>My step brother has one and I've done a few hundred miles on it total.

I trailered it to the Triumph dealership. The owner/manager checked out my mint condition 2008 SD with 2300 miles and new rear tyre just installed. We agreed on a trade-in value but he didn't have a STR available. Seriously didn't think he could get his hands on one seeing they were sold out and waiting for them to be shipped. He wanted to sell me a plain ST he had in the show room. I wasn't interested in taking a step back for something that didn't have the components similar to the SD. It had to be a STR. We were going to stay in touch in case a STR surfaced. I was leaving and their sales guy came out to look at the SD knowing my interest in the STR. He looked at me and said, "Why would you want to trade this for a Street Triple R?", basically telling me I would be foolish to make such a deal. Needless to say, I put another 3300 miles on the SD this year, wore out a back tyre and was glad I didn't make that deal. <br>I do seriously think a KTM SM-R could be in my future. If I were you, I would trade that pre-enjoyed, high mileage SMR and for another $6600 have a new bike with a warranty. <br>Where's that dealer so I can trade in my 2008 SD (with existing factory warranty).</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/omky756.svg" alt=omky756> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">omky756</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-19 18:10:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
