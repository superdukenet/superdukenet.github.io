The long and short, we started in Thousand Oaks, CA and ended up in Santa Barbara using only back roads. We had some lunch, and since it was unseasonably cool and damp, decided to call it a day.<br><br>We decided to slab it back. As soon as I hit the freeway onramp, my heart dropped. Traffic on the 101, purportedly the most travelled freeway in the world, was three lanes, bumper to bumper for as far as the eye can see. It was lane sharing time.<br><br>California drivers are one of two types. Some eagerly move out of your way. Others try to cut you off. So, lane sharing can get interesting to say the least. At best, it requires a lot of concentration to avoid getting squashed.<br><br>I putted alone through about ten miles of this mess with no end in sight. My riding partner, who was in front of me on the offramp, hit a small gap in traffic when he pulled onto the freeway. The gap was immediately closed by an 18 wheeler and I never saw him after that. After traversing about 15 miles of this nonsense, I decided to get off the freeway and take the back roads home.<br><br>So I got off the freeway and started my lonesome trek home. It was pretty awesome. Very little traffic. Clean roads. Life was good. Because I was tired, and my nerves were frayed from the jaunt on the freeway and because there were cops EVERYWHERE, I decided to be a good boy on the ride home. Speeding, which is the state pastime in CA, would be OK, but absolutely no crossing double yellows.<br><br>You have to understand, most people EXPECT, motorcyclists to pass on a double yellow. Lots of cars will even move over to let you past. But, I decided that unless someone actually pulled off the road, I wasn't going to pass on the double yellow. My decision actually seemed to piss a few drivers off, but the ticket for crossing a double yellow is huge and invites and added reckless charge, so NO.<br><br>I made it about 1/2 way home before my decision became frustrating. First, I came upon two bikers following a string of cars through some moderately twisty bits. One bike was a sport tourer, like an FJR or Concourse. The other Was a Gixxer 1000. The dude on the Gixxer was having a heck of a time keeping the bike between the lines. The Concourse rider was actually pretty good. He never strayed out of his 1/2 of the lane through the twisty bits.<br><br>I did not want to follow these two all the way home, so I turned off the main road and took a shortcut to get in front of them. This worked great, but I found myself behind a huge 18 wheeler. Luckily he turned off, so I started to wick it up. No sooner do I get rolling, when I come upon 4 Hardley Abelson riders (two abreast - mostly). Now we get to the title of my post.<br><br>Have you ever seen the Clint Eastwood movie, "Every Which Way But Loose?" Picture those guys. They shopped at the same garage sales. <br><br>So, if you thought the Gixxer guys were point and shoot guys, believe me, you've never met these fookers. They would park it in the corners, then blast off, well as much as a Harley can blast off, down the straights. Of course, their bikes had no baffles whatsoever so the noise was ridiculous. True to my pledge, I refused to pass them on the double yellow. Unfortunately, there was only one place to pass on this road, and it is frequently patrolled by LEOS with radar, so I decided I would just follow them. I wasn't in a huge hurry. Life was good, I was trying to break my prejudice against loud Harley riders. After all, we are all bikers, right?<br><br>So, as I'm following this motley crew, I observe their riding style. Roll up to a corner marked 30 mph at 50, click down two gears (rev matching of course to hear that awesome Harley thunder) look for a place to park int the corner, ride though the corner at 25 mph, decide you can't find a space then blast out of the corner like a bat out of hell (literally, not figuratively, the bikes weren't that fast) approach another corner and repeat. <br><br>On one of these corners, a 30 mph left hander, the last bike motioned for me to slow down. Apparently, he was concerned for my well being on this treacherous up coming corner. I responded by reaching back and scratching my ass as I rode though the corner one handed. <br><br>I still stuck to my plan, but I actually let them speed away from me more. I think it gave them a chubby to watch me vanish in their mirrors, but I don't know that they thought when I showed up on their asses ever time they reached a corner. <br><br>Unfortunately, it became apparent that these guys were headed for the same destination as me. My route took me right past a HD dealership. But, I knew our route would have a couple of legal passing opportunities. All I needed to do was be patient. This time, however, my patience almost backfired (no pun intended).<br><br>As we pulled from a side road onto the main drag, we encountered two men. One was on horseback. The other was leading a beautiful white stallion. The stallion looked like an enormous Arabian. As the azzhole Harley riders performed their point and shoot technique to enter the road and accelerate to 70 mph, with all four engines popping and snorting, both horses startled. The man on horseback was almost thrown, and the horse being lead kicked violently rearward then reared up (Lone Ranger style) and began trying to stomp the guy leading him. Fortunately, after the first two Harleys roared past, he got the horse under control, but this scene actually seemed to please the Harley douches. If that horse had broken loose and charged across the road, I might have been killed.<br><br>About a 1/2 mile ahead, the first passing zone I mentioned above appeared and with renewed vigor, the douche bag Harley riders, certain to teach me who was boss, poured on the gas. I could almost see there wee willies shrivel as the mighty Superduke blew by them like they were standing still. Of course, that straight was followed by a 30 mph right hander and while I had no problem negotiating it at twice that speed or more, while our heros had to go through the revving downshift ritual. I was, of course, long gone by then. It wasn't long before the road turned twisty and the Harley fags faded into memory. That is, until I encountered a string of cars toddling up my favorite canyon road. Ten minutes later, the Harley boys showed up behind me again.<br><br>One final passing zone and they were gone for good. They are probably still scratching their heads trying to figure out what that black bike with the orange accents that was fast as lightening was. After all, orange and black are Harley colors, aren't they?<br><br>Lessons learned: (1) Loud pipes are just as apt to kill you as to save your life. (2) Sometimes it pays to cross a double yellow. (3) Avoid Harley fags like the plague. </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/cdlabate.svg" alt=cdlabate> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">cdlabate</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-13 04:56:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>...and don't do drugs kids.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/lobster.svg" alt=lobster> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">lobster</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-13 07:00:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Ah, the Black Widows.... <a class=postlink href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azxFvvUtu40&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azxFvvUt ... re=related</a></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/indy84.svg" alt=indy84> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">indy84</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-13 07:48:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Superdan.svg" alt=Superdan> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Superdan</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-13 08:21:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Nice writing </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Superdan.svg" alt=Superdan> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Superdan</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-13 09:13:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Aussieduke.svg" alt=Aussieduke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Aussieduke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-13 09:21:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Just an idea:<br><br><a class=postlink href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph</a><br><br> </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/indy84.svg" alt=indy84> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">indy84</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-13 09:36:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/BlueFlame.svg" alt=BlueFlame> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">BlueFlame</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-13 10:00:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Crotchrockety.svg" alt=Crotchrockety> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Crotchrockety</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-13 12:49:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I must watch too many movies.<br>I was expecting you to tell me, the 4 HD's boxed you in on the freeway, led you to the side of the road and proceeded to kick the *(&amp;^%^&amp;

I bring both bikes the duke will be for the canyons rock store runs and the tavern,The HD is for the wife and I on beach runs or just enjoying the ride.Many guys have HD's and other brands mostley ones they can go fast thru the twisties.So I think to call all harley riders fags is not smart.That will cause you more harm than loud pipes.Look at the vests if they have 3 sets of patches top middle and a bottom rocker then you are seeing a club Or gang like you like to call it.All I can say is tread carefull with those.In that area you have mongals and H A's call one of those guys a fag see what happens.My advice is ride the way you want just be cool and don't piss them off.If there too slow pass them do a two finger wave and be on your way.trust me unless you disrespect them they will not give a crap about you.give respect and you get it back.If fact don't be surprized if they tell how nice your bike is at a light.We live in a world that is full of stereo type.we don't need that crap with brother riders.If you ride two wheels we are in the same club.We have enough trouble with the people that drive cages.We don't need it in motorcyles.we have to have tolarance.Some guys or girls have no business being on a bike.but it's a free country.If they bother you then ride past them break a law if you have to.Not like you never have if you have a duke.I break laws everytime I ride it.Yes orange and black is HD.Prejudice is bad.Even if you think it is funny or the cool thing to do.It's not good at any time.You may think you are not but your statements say you are.Just remember we are all brothers and yes some good and some bad.On all brands of bikes.I see this shit all the time.most of the time it's from a guy that has never owned a Harley.You have to own one then you can understand.I love them all If I won the lotto I would have a 20,000 foot garage with ducks, apes, hogs you name I would have one of everything and love it.So be cool bro we all love the same thing.Just differant ways of showing it.<br><br>Thank you for your concern about my personal welfare. I was never in danger. Nah, no 1%ers. I looked up the name of their organization, and its a social club. Its not important who they were. They were just a bunch of guys with loud pipes out terrorizing the countryside on a Sunday afternoon. If anyone would be in danger if they encountered a bunch of REAL 1%ers, it would be those guys not me. They were the ones dressed like bad asses and riding Harleys acting bad assed. I was just dressed like a safety Nazi in my A*s leather jacket and pants putting along on my Austrian bike.<br><br>The point of my thread was apparently lost in its length. California just passed a law, signed by the Harley riding Guvenator, to ban aftermarket pipes that were not EPA approved for bikes manufactured after 1/1/13. I thought this kinda sucked, because I like my Leos, but after yesterday, I can totally understand why it happened. Loud pipes damn near killed those two guys on horseback. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of horses, but they were on their property, minding their own business and almost got there heads kicked in. THIS WAS A BIG FOOKING HORSE. <br><br>So, while I agree with you that "we all love the same thing," the corollary is that you can't just do whatever you want. You have to respect the rights of others. Loud pipes may be cool to you, but they can be a downright menace to someone else. I think I also understand why the CA bill originated in Agoura, CA - horse country.<br><br>For the record, my CF Leos with baffles in, did not seem to spook the horses. The straight pipes were the culprit.<br><br>As for the Harley Fags reference, didn't you know Websters officially changed the definition of Fags from homosexuals to loud obnoxious Harley riders? http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-ep ... the-f-word</a><br><br>Peace.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-13 14:11:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Crotchrockety.svg" alt=Crotchrockety> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Crotchrockety</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-13 14:23:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Rather than just banning loud pipes wouldn't a better idea be to educate bike riders?

I've seen them as deep as 10 bikes (20 bike pack). I"ve ridden Harleys and have friends who ride them, and know for a fact that they can be ridden at or above the speed limit. <br><br>There is no law I'm aware of that prevents these rolling cavalcades that are on the road for what ever purpose, but the fact remains that they do impose an impediment to traffic, period. My experience with each and every one is one of "we have a right to be here and we're not breaking any laws, so too bad if you think we're going to slow". Which, technically is absolutely correct, but trying to pass one of these groups doing 45 in a 55 zone in the average passing zone will put you in a speed zone that usually is worthy of a reckless driving summons and/or on the spot incarceration and impoundment.<br><br>However, riding is not only about being technically correct. It's also about being courteous, and that applies to ALL riders, the slow Harley packs out to show off their latest 10 lbs of chrome, the sportbike rider who passes against double yellow lines doing wheelies past cagers with screaming pipes every bit as loud and obnoxious as any Harley straight pipe, the "Ghost Rider" Rebel Without a Clue Mentality. <br><br>A little patience. Consideration for others. Assuming responsibilty for yourself and the effects of your actions on others. Realization that traffic laws like speed limits and lines on the road are put there for reasons of safety, yours included.<br><br>Edited to add: the original post doesn't impress me as a "run-in" with a bike gang. I tend to think of that as taking place in/outside a bar at night and involving brass knuckles, knives, and being hopelessly outnumbered in a manner as to avoid any sort of physical injury. This post could just as easily been titled: ""Had a run in with a white haired old lady in a 1966 Ford".</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DucatiPete.svg" alt="Ducati Pete"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Ducati Pete</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-14 15:42:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Sprocket.svg" alt=Sprocket> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Sprocket</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-15 18:22:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Harley riders are all tossers as i have found with the local HA ----------------wank--s </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DannyTwo.svg" alt=Danny_Two> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Danny_Two</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-15 19:36:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Dont really have any problems with the HD crew near me.<br>I live in North Yorkshire and theres too many twisty bits for them. <br>Must admit i do see a few on a sunny day parked up at Sherburn cafe but think they must jump off the motorway nearby.<br>Anyway each to their own,i dont go on motoways on my bikes.?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Willh.svg" alt=Willh> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Willh</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-15 20:04:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/990EXODUS.svg" alt=990EXODUS> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">990EXODUS</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-17 12:02:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>In my whole time driving across Cali I hardly saw any bikes, saw a couple of Angels in San Lois Obispo but that was about all.
