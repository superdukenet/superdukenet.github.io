NOT a track-biased race-rep, stripped down for road use. I would vote that it stays that way, so for me, NO to a bare-naked RC8.<br><br>I'd also want to see the basic look and feel evolve, rather than have a revolution. The looks aren't dated and it needs updating, not starting over. Triumph have shown how the Speed Triple can evolve without killling the brand.<br><br>For me I'd just like to see a new similar looking Duke, but with a bit more power, slipper clutch as standard (or copy the clever fuelling in the new RC8R which eliminates harsh engine braking on shutoff), and everything slightly upgraded... Nothing radical. An underslung or shortie exhaust would modernise the looks and lower the CofG, a bendy RC8 style swingarm would be stiffer and looks better, an RC8 style tail section, even for the standard 2seat bike would be nice, I like the SMR Y-Spoke wheels, and then it's just a question of what they do with the suspension and brakes, but no traction control or ABS please.<br><br>So, in summary:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Design</span>: Keep it and evolve it, but not too much change, except maybe the rear end of the standard SD.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Engine: </span>A bit more power, but my 130 RWBHP is pretty good already. Make that the standard and tuneable to 150? - but sort the fuelling.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Zorst: </span>Underslung or Shortie please<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Chassis &amp; Suspension: </span>Slight upgrades, nothing massive needed. RC8 bendy swingarm? Y-Spoke Wheels, Big piston forks, etc...<br><br>...<br>Anyway, let's get this thread cooking and then we can send it to KTM.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Jody.svg" alt=Jody> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Jody</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-19 15:13:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Maybe make a 1200cc engine with more torque so we can keep it in a particular gear for a tad longer, but I dont want huge horse power figures as it would end up like an aprillia tuono, just a sports bike minus a fairing.

The bike has gone through an " upgrade",and most people think that the only benefit was the miles per tank load.

I have never been on a motorcycle that has or had a better suspension and am hard pressed to imagine that a bike in this price range could be better or even equall to this one. This bike serves it's purpose, I wouls spend my money on a differant style-use long before I would need the next iteration.

I certainly wouldn't mind a little bit of change, as long as when it comes out, everyone will know right away that it's the new Super Duke. One of the guys mentioned to keep it similar but to keep it up to date much like Triumph did with the Speed Triple, that's a great example.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AGRO.svg" alt="AGRO!"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AGRO!</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-20 04:53:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>As an SD-R and RC8R owner, Id like to see the SD-R evolve more into a baby RC8R. Keep the engine at 990. Make it a light, quick power band. The fueling on the RC8R was perfect for me and if that could be applied to the SD-R id be in heaven. Bring the seat material from the RC8 to the SDR with a little bit more padding. Maybe the adjustable subframe and pegs. Soften the suspension a bit from the factory. The SD-R always feels really stiff on the streets, but i guess thats the price to pay. The RC8R doesnt feel this way or at least not nearly as bad. <br><br>FIX THE GOD DAMN EXPANDING TANK!!!<br><br>The screws for the RC8R body are all one size which is one of those blatantly obvious things that even Ducati doesn't do. Yet. <br><br>I really like the way KTM has their styling so I cant offer any improvements. Whomever does the styling always gets this image thats right in your face and im not sure if I like it, but once I get to see the details and the stance i love it. Its not that fluid "race on sunday sell on monday" design, its muscular, raw and aggressive... Id say if Ducati styling is like Ferrari, then KTM styling is like Lamborghini. Even with the horrible riding experience that I've had on the SD-R and the crappy parts availability and dealer support, i still put money down and gambled on the RC8R Red Bull because of the styling. It kept bringing me back. Its just a gorgeous bike.<br><br>And that white ring that keeps the headlight bulb in the headlight assembly, sell that separate from the headlight assembly so i dont have too spend $190 for just the white ring.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DavoSingapore.svg" alt=Davo-Singapore> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Davo-Singapore</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-20 05:52:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Crotchrockety.svg" alt=Crotchrockety> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Crotchrockety</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-20 15:05:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Imo KTM should phase out the 990 LC8 and introduce new 2012 onward models with an updated RC8 motor. With all the new competitve bikes that have been released in the last few years it would be a huge mistake for KTM to continue with the 990 LC8, at least here in the US. <br><br>I love my bike and it's motor but if you look at the specs compared to it's main competition it doesn't measure up, It loses sales to the Streetfighter because of it. The Adventure and SMT loses sales to the Multistrada for the same reason.

Perhaps it’s because the SD is a deliberately quirky “none of the above” choice signifying an individualistic attitude. For me a bike is a bike to be appreciated or otherwise on its merits. I couldn’t care less who makes it or what message their marketing department are spinning at the time. KTM exists to deliver a return to its shareholders, if it does this by manufacturing a machine that makes me laugh then I’m happy.<br><br>When I buy a bike I like to think that I am only minimally influenced by the bike press. My main criteria are probably very close to many other peoples. It’s a toy bought to amuse not a utility item so number one is that it gives me the horn and makes me smile. To do this I have to like or at least be able to stomach the way it looks and most importantly have fun expressing myself on it on the road. Elements that feed into that most are engine performance, sound, handling including braking and comfort. Beyond that I consider if it’s likely to be reliable and re saleable without losing a fortune. After all I’m owning and not marrying it.<br><br>I’m neutral on the looks, brutal angry insect sums it up, but I think that’s perfect differentiation from everything else out there without being too off putting to the wider biking public. Small incremental change would be best, a refresh not a re design. If they have any sense they will offer a lower seat height option as I have two mates who might be tempted but are too short for the current version. Personally not being a short arse I like the tall stance. I also like the display on the RC8 so perhaps something like that would be good, new wheels are an easy way to change the look as well as providing the opportunity to boast about unsprung weight reduction etc.<br><br>I struggled to adapt to the handling for a while after a lifetime on sports bikes but once I got it I liked it a lot. If you can be bothered there is plenty of adjustment in the excellent suspension, the brakes are as good or better than any bike I have had before. On rougher roads I think its actually faster than a pure sports bike because of the long travel high quality suspension. I find it quite comfortable as well so I think changes in all these areas will be mostly cosmetic and for marketing purposes.<br><br>For KTM to sell more, which after all is what they are focused on, they will need to excite the media and the only way to do that is produce some big numbers. IMO this is to our advantage too. Top speed is out because at higher three figure speed aerodynamics and not power rule the roost. A power boost would still be to our advantage however as it would give better acceleration and more lofting of the front wheel which I suspect is a major pastime of many SD owners. Some people here seem to think 150+ RWHP is undesirable on a naked. On the contrary, as long as it’s not all stuffed into a narrow band at the top of the rev range I think the more the merrier. The electric trickery is more a defence against being sued than a practical necessity, like everybody else if it’s fitted I would want to be able to disable / turn it off. Significant power / torque hike should be on the list because it will sell more bikes and be more fun for us.<br><br>Mine had been reliable except for the battery requiring replacement although I have only done a limited mileage on it so far. As for depreciation I’m guessing with a niche brand in a small market there is probably not much to be done about that. If worried then selling the current model before news of a replacement becomes widespread would be a smart move I guess.<br><br>My predictions then are a modest restyle, trick sounding new suspension, different wheels, tall and short arse options, Ducati + levels of power and the CSR inspired traction / abs options. An underslung exhaust would tidy the back up a bit, an RC8 style rear (retaining two up potential) would look good and feed into the KTM design theme, new colour options and a more sophisticated dash to top it all off.<br><br>If it were being made just for me it would be lighter, faster, louder and simpler. The older I get the less I care about bling and the more I care about entertainment and simplicity.<br><br>Another over wordy post from me, now I’m off to check if the London drinks meet has been sorted yet.....</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-21 19:14:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Zenbiker.svg" alt=Zenbiker> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Zenbiker</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-21 20:47:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Screw Traction Control.

The engine has to make good usable power from idle to red limit and be silky smooth without a power band where it all comes on at a specific RPM. Fix the fueling issues and make it easy for customers to tweak the fueling via a provided KTM program similar to TuneECU. Full ABS and Switchable TC also sounds good. If the competitors are going to have it so should KTM or KTM may loss customers. Upgrade everything else while your at it. Better brakes, slipper clutch as standard, linkage rear suspension to name a few. Keep the bike weight as low as it is now or best yet, lighter! My KTM SDR is the first KTM I have ever owned. I really love the bike but if it doesn't keep up with the other makers bike in terms of advancements I may have to switch brands. I'm not a brand die-hard, I buy what I perceive as the best bike in it's class. By the time the new SD/SDR come out I'll be ready for a new bike, what I buy depends what is available, it maybe a KTM and maybe not.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AndersH.svg" alt=AndersH> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AndersH</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-21 21:39:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>more power, no more power. tc/abs no tc/abs. bigger, smaller............. think ktm are gona have to make a new super duke AND a new HYPER DUKE.... </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/jambox.svg" alt=jambox> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">jambox</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-21 22:32:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-22 00:16:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Dont let the bike get heavier.

You can change the firing order to get the characteristics of a twin and get higher revs allong with it. I think that the SD would be a great 990 v4. The biggest concern is that the SD needs to stay in the same vein as the existing. Look and feel need not change, power delivary at its current state of tune is wonderful in its linear compisition. This could be done with a V4. If the exhaust moved to underslung, it may afford the placement of the battery and electrics back to under seat. Devising a way to top up oil without panel removal would be splendid. My trouble is that in looking at SD evolution,one can quickly morf the exercise into another steed altogether. If we look at the evolving Duke as an example, we see more CC's an elextric start an underslung exhaust, more fuel capacity, upgraded brakes, but still essentially the same steed. It would be logical to take the new SD forward in the same way. Ilike the cam configguration of the LC motor, it affords a tighter platform and leaves the wheel span shorter. I hate to say it but the SD is such a slendid road bike that luggage adaptability and fifty more miles between fill ups is all this bike needs.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MrZ32.svg" alt=MrZ32> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">MrZ32</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-22 23:21:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>A v-4 would not be a superduke anymore, and with Aprilia moving to a V-4 Tuono this year, it may sway more people to the KTM to get their fix of riding naked twins.<br><br>As nice as the exhaust note of a V-4 is, it still cannot compare to the thunder of a sport V-Twin.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ShadeTheChangingMan.svg" alt=ShadeTheChangingMan> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">ShadeTheChangingMan</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-23 08:47:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Forgot about this pic but Isn't this what we wanted?<br><img src="http://i1047.photobucket.com/albums/b479/davo-singapore/SDR/748c7dae.jpg" alt=Image></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/mrduke.svg" alt=mrduke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">mrduke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-23 09:12:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ShadeTheChangingMan.svg" alt=ShadeTheChangingMan> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">ShadeTheChangingMan</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-23 16:39:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Willh.svg" alt=Willh> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Willh</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-23 16:57:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Less weight,<br><br>Skinnier,<br><br>stock slipper clutch,<br><br>adjustable pegs(down and forward as well as up and back), bars, seat, etc.,<br><br>tool-less pre-load adjustment for the rear,<br><br>longer service interval, <br><br>tool-less oil top-ups,<br><br>less headlight protrusion, I honestly prefer the first generation headlight-tank combo,<br><br>aluminium or light weight steel fuel tank,<br><br>different tanks available through power parts for a choice available to commuters-touring and real small hooligan tank,(2-3 gallons, something smaller, skinnier and allowing the rider to get farther forward than the one on my 2008).<br><br>I won't be buying another SD anytime soon.

and foremost the SD is a naked street bike designed to be ridden hard and aggressively with no unneccessary extras, just jump on and shred and I don't want that to change.<br><br>It's a plus that it's design has enabled me to do track work, commuting as well as the expected weekend shredding with little fuss but I wouldn't want to see it change it's primary focus as that's why I bought it in the first place, where magazines said 2nd place for being too aggressive, I said yes please and plenty of it.<br><br>For the std SD I'd like a version of the RC8 engine, I think the original RC8 engine from the 08 RC8s may be ideal, it wasn't designed to be a full on screamer with loads of top end it was designed to be a very useable engine through the range and as std puts out 140 at the rear wheel.<br><br>The R version could perhaps have a version of the RC8R engine with the extra oomph that they gave it but still stroked towards the torque side of things.<br><br>You're not gonna get fancy wheels on the std version, they're not putting them on the RC8R anymore which although this is also to do with them removing the std RC8 from the line up and meeting in the middle somewhere there's pretty much no chance they'll put the wheels on the SD in order to keep a good price point for it, especially considering all the unsold ones they had originally.<br><br>On an R version there could be a chance perhaps of having the wheels and if they do then the existing power part ones from the SMR/RC8R would be awesome.<br><br>Suspension wise the std SD should just continue with quality components like it does already with whatever tweaks or improvements have been made in the industry, the R version should have more track orientated suspension, the same sort of kit as the RC8R would be lovely.<br><br>Swingarm should be beefed up, it will not be detrimental to the street only riders and will also give the track goers more stiffness, I'm not sure whether it should look like or use the RC8 swingarm or not, perhaps it should have it's own style, I quite like the girder look of the 125 duke, perhaps a beefier version of that would look cool, I'm sure KTM can sort out something tasty.<br><br>On that tone, more adjustablility on the yolks for the R version as well like with the nichols clamp, I personally love the sharp turning of my 05 but being able to adjust the geomertry in both directions would be awesome on a track orientated bike with negligible engineering time required to fulfil it.<br><br>I think perhaps design elements from the RC8 tail /subframe would be nice, such as the quick release pillion seat, adjustable height and the pillion peg fittings designed to still look neat and tidy when removed and also quick and easy to do so, but maybe it should keep the more kind of edginess of the current SDR tail as they both look good in their own rights and the SDR gives you quick access to storage whereas the RC8 has none at all, so perhaps something in the middle would be ideal if that's even possible. if the std SD is to stick with a similar tail like it has already got then it should be cleaned up and smoothed out a bit on the underside with an undertray or something.<br><br>I would love an underslung exhaust so long as it doesn't impact on ground clearance or the general handling of the bike, they managed it with the RC8 and it's no taller than the SD so I think there's a chance they could do it on the SD too so long as any repositioning of other components such as tank and seat etc doesn't start to make it look too much like a sports bike with no fairing, overall ground clearance as a whole should be improved regardless of exhaust, I'd still be happy if they brought out another underseat exhaust setup to keep em up out the way if it's not possible to get one underneath and improve clearance.<br><br>I think headlight should be in the vein of the stacked Duke headlight but perhaps a bit beefier looking, not too skinny that it looks like one that somebody would stick on a custom bike, HIDs as std would be awesome.<br><br>I'd expect the instrument cluster will be the Zadi one off the RC8/Xbow etc and that would be cool, keeping the race mode and lap time functions as well.<br><br>Adjustable footrests like on the RC8 so you don't have to really adjust the pedals in order to move them up and down but with removable heel guards so you can go your own flavour and so you can just replace them when your boots have rubbed away the texture as the fixed heel guard on the RC8 is just annoying.<br><br>What I don't want<br><br>The SD is not a tourer so I don't want luggage options or massive fuel tanks messing up the lines of the bike, so long as I can still whack a kriega on the back and or a tank bag on the front I'm happy and so if i choose to travel on it I will but not at the cost of it's essence as a hooligans bike, if you want that then ask mr KTM for an SDT or just buy the SMT instead . (A quick release bag like on the RC8 could be good but that's as far as it should go, and even then at £100 it was a bit too much)</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/GoGo.svg" alt=GoGo> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">GoGo</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-24 20:18:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">Rake and Trail</span></span> numbers toned down a bit from so radical. Not sure why manufacturers do this, perhaps it's to make the bikes "feel" easy to turn, quick to react. Problem is there's a down-side to that once you get up to speed. And you don't have to get to stupid speed to feel the downside. Headshake, instability, front-end tucks entering turns.

I've been lucky enough to race the Superduke, the Superduke R, and the Superduke R with a braced swingarm - same tracks, same conditions, same tyres, all different configurations of Superduke. Trust me the braced swingarm is a huge improvement. The bike changes direction more positively, turns at high speed more stable and consistent, and (for some reason I can't explain why) seems to put the power to the ground more predictably - you can drive out harder, earlier, with less lateral movement/wallowing. Doesn't take race pace to feel the difference either. Those little arms flex..<br><br><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">Better Airbox</span></span>.

It's so GREAT to read everyone's posts on this subject and to realise what a bunch of focussed, intelligent, SD brand loyal bunch of people this forum has. I can't add anything that hasn't already been said, - a very unified, collective appraisal and set of demands we expect from KTM in their next generation of Superduke. I especially concur with all the comments Twisted Jester makes, (he knows his stuff and has the SD and the RC8), and also Go Go's because he's the racing guy and totally speaks from hard won experience. (I already have a spare swing arm here which I'm currently drawing plans for to be modified/braced by a specialist firm because it's the only thing I can think of for this years major mods. to make my '07 model better. PS. Go Go if you have any data about the bracing you did that you wouldn't mind sharing I would really appreciate it!! ).<br><br>Message to KTM.......<br><br>On this forum we think there must be someone who reads this stuff. (If not you are all missing a trick.) So PLEASE listen to what we are saying. We are not asking for the world. Everything mentioned is achievable and if you do release a new version of the SD then we believe that it has the potential to reclaim the title for the best of it's class. Or perhaps we really want it to be the stand out and be a class leader in a class of its own because what is obvious is that we don't want the new SD to be a stripped down superbike. We want it to be a single minded hooligan machine with the potential for track work. Everyone I know who takes the SD to a track.... their main joy is showing race-rep jockeys that you don't have to be a sportsbike to go round fast. There is a market for this - it's your unique selling point.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Crotchrockety.svg" alt=Crotchrockety> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Crotchrockety</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-27 01:00:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DavoSingapore.svg" alt=Davo-Singapore> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Davo-Singapore</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-27 01:38:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>sweet! check this out...<br><br><a class=postlink href="http://hellforleathermagazine.com/">http://hellforleathermagazine.com/</a></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Dutch.svg" alt=Dutch> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Dutch</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-27 01:55:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Dutch.svg" alt=Dutch> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Dutch</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-27 09:24:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-27 09:57:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Dutch.svg" alt=Dutch> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Dutch</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-27 10:01:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>How about this...

Example : I had an early Suzuki 1200 Bandit that produced 96 bhp ( 1997 when they were at the best ), and my brother owns it now amongst other toys. If we go out for a ride and he guns it in a straight line, my SD will not touch it, yet my SD is 118bhp and weighs about 25kg lighter. Its all about use able power and getting that power to the road in the best ( and most fun way ). I want a bit more, lets say 130 bhp max using a 1200cc engine, and if we read correctly from some recent blurb, a 1200 version looks what we will be getting from KTM. I love my SD, and its at its heart a "Road" bike with engine characteristics that make each and everyone on this forum love it. If they made huge BHP you might end up only having fun when going at 110% which is not what the SD is about. Yes I love it when gunning it and getting the back end a bit squiffy,but the SD is just a pleasure doing anything and it would be a bore otherwise or like having a 1000cc in line 4 that you only ever use three quarters of.At the end of the day I'm sure KTM will have something special for us, or should they actually make the "Venom" from RC8 bits, otherwise could they still call the new bike a Superduke.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/easze76.svg" alt=easze76> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">easze76</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-29 18:59:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Just for info, HIDs are not road legal in the UK on bikes, only cars.<br><br>I stilla have one though.

There are plenty of other KTM’s that can have or use all of the techno stuff and stuff for the “penny-loafer” crowd but the Super Duke and Duke models need to keep the personality they were born and raised with. The original 620 Duke I was touted as the first hooligan street brawler and this was typical of KTM with always doing it different than the other brands. Cycle World Magazine put it best when their opening line to the first test of the Duke I read: “Rude, Crude and Socially Unacceptable……in other words Way Damn Cool”. Then went on to say “Stay away from this bike, no good can come of it” and then something to the affect of the Duke being the quickest way to get in trouble and lose your license, etc. If KTM starts to chase the other brands or their customers then they become one of them and who in their right mind wants to be “One of them” or really tens of thousands of them. The Super Duke is not for everyone, man am I happy about that. As long as KTM sells enough of them to maintain that bad azz image I’m sure they’ll be happy because they can then make the SMT and Adventure’s and whatever else that is more attractive to the masses and put all of the creature features on them for the candy butts. Maintaining the original Duke/Super Duke raw concept and image is the most important new thing KTM can do. So for me a much lighter conventional high rear mounted “in your face” (or at least in the face of the person behind you) exhaust system and maybe a better headlight is all I’d want. I don’t need a padded shift lever for my loafers save that for someone else.<br><br>SD#1</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bikenutter.svg" alt=bikenutter> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bikenutter</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-17 06:04:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>For me the SD has completely changed the way I ride &amp; it's nicked seconds off my lap times so the current SD will take some improving.

OK I admit that I am in love with her (05), And I believe that even for you (KTM) will be dificult or even imposible to desighn something that will make me fall in love for a second time.<br><br>"SWORN" to you...<br>George</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DucatiPete.svg" alt="Ducati Pete"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Ducati Pete</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-20 21:01:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>OOOOOOOOOOhhhhhhhhhh<br><br>I forgot the most important... </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/990WFO.svg" alt="990 WFO"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">990 WFO</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-26 15:27:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I dont post often, but here are my few wants, <br><br>Standard RC8 Engine, dont detune it, allow any and all nanny devices (ABS etc) to be turned off or dont fit them!<br><br>No tool fluid checks and top ups!!

Doesn't have to be a bigger engine (improved stock airbox?).<br>Same awesome style. Went to a 300-bike event a few days ago. Lots of people checked out the SD and asked me about it.<br>Keep the same awesome braking performance. Has saved me many times.<br>For those with a SDR or riding with an SDR seat (like me), a rear support would be nice. Especially when punching it in the lower gears and you slide backwards a couple inches because there's nothing but smooth seat behind you.<br>Keep the same dimensions!!! Screw trying to make a bike semi-comfortable for all the different heights. It never works! You end up with a bike that isn't really comfortable at all for anyone. Keep it tall and slim. <br>Easier maintenance. <br><br>Thats really about it. As I said before, KTM doesn't need to over-haul the bike. Improve on the good things and touch up on the bad things. A slipper-clutch and steering damper would be nice to have but I think these things would eventually push the bike to being nothing more than a naked RC8. I see the SD as a completely different bike than the RC8, not just its little brother. It should stay that way. <br><br>And BTW in case KTM is wondering, KEEP IT A TWIN!!!

Fewer drains, or at least placing them where they won't drip on the few fairings the bike has and making the oil drain plug more accessible would be nice too.<br><br>Also, providing a storage space that is at least big enough for a wallet AND waterproof would be helpful, along with a low mounted exhaust.

If that means going to a different type of plastic that is not subject to the same type of deformation problems that the current "paintable" nylon version is and then using some kind of bolt on tank covers (similar to what Ducati has done with the Diavel) then do it. Or if it means going to a metal tank then do that but sticking with the status quo is simply unacceptable and I can guarantee you it will be a deal breaker for many U.S. customers regardless of how much we love our KTM's or how superior the new SD is to it's competition. This is not the kind of problem a $14K bike should be subject to. <br><br>Other than that the current SD is a masterpiece in my opinion. The overall concept is brilliant and it's possibly the best performance bike for the real world that has ever been produced. Of course, there is still always room for improvement. More power without a sacrifice in power delivery and torque will be necessary to keep up with the competiton. No need for a naked bike to compete with an S1000RR in terms of topend horsepower but it should have enough to at least keep the Kawasaki Z1000 honest and stay reasonably close to the Ducati Streetfighter. <br><br>The swingarm should be closer to the one used on the RC8R. Leave the dirtbike style arm to the true Supermotos. The SD leans closer to the Super Naked side of the fence than supermoto. Make the bars slightly lower and slightly less wide but keep all of that glorious leg room. Also, there's no need for a bunch of electronic fancy gizmos that will inevitably malfunction. A non-undertail exhaust would be nice and please continue to offer a standard more street orientated version. The R is amazing but now that you have a nicely refined RC8R there's more need for the SD to be a great streetbike than a track tool.

Lotta die hards want to keep the SD the same...while I can understand this it's highly unlikely. If I were in the market today to buy a naked sportsbike I'd be looking at the Streetfighter or 1090RR Brutale as they will stomp the SD performance wise. It's inevitable that KTM will have to step it up to compete with these two if they want to make any money.<br><br>Asthetically I think the Frogs nailed it. Follows the original formula nicely incorporating a fresh look without deviating too much from the bike we all love (albeit would love much more if it had an additional 20-25hp at the rear).<br><br>Money is the reason any company is in buisness. KTM did not make much (if any money) on the SD here in the US. Reason is simple really. $14K USD for a naked when you could buy a fully faired superbike that would stomp it in every measureable catagory for less than $11K USD. The SD was bound to fail. Thing is, when they started blowing them out at $9K everyone suddenly realised what a great bike it is (and I mean GREAT!). I've done a couple track days recently on the SD and could not believe how capable the bike is on track. With a few more HP at the back it would be the perfect bike (damn near is right now on the street).<br><br>The average age of motorcyclists in the USA is 46...that's me. I want all the peformance without the compromise of a full on superbike. The SD comes real close. A few more ponies and it'll be perfect.<br><br>Hopefully KTM will not deviate from the original too much. If they slot an RC8R motor, chassis and suspension into the formula...update the asthetics a bit (like I said the Frogs nailed it) and sort the well known issues we've all dealt with I will be the first in line to puchase the new one.<br><br>Oh, KTM, one other thing, step it up on the quality of the plating for the fasteners and other bits...corrosion on a two year old bike (in So Cal) is unacceptable.<br><br>PS - Black frame please!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TLSRuss.svg" alt=TLS_Russ> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TLS_Russ</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-29 15:49:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>As long as KTM dont make it along the lines of the new 690 duke which looks like a half finished bits and pieces bike, then i dont care...KTM have a habit especially with the big vtwins of using the same headlights, rear lights and..well everything...to make things cheaper...honda do the same...the cbf600 has the same back light as the 1000cb...if they do have to share something, please dont make it that flat number board with glass in it, namely the dukes headlight ...<br><br>as for me..<br>slipper clutch<br>lower bars<br>rear sets as standard<br>easier oil change<br>battery back under the seat or somewhere accessible.<br>better fuel consumption..(if bmw can do it..so can KTM)</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Stratkat.svg" alt=Stratkat> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Stratkat</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-12-05 16:59:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>its kind of curious to me that there have been no spy shots of a model thats clearly well underway. i remember reading test rides of the 05 version when it was a smaller displacement bfore it was ready for production. i find that odd. the RC8 was shown waaaay before they released it.<br><br>i cant wait to see the new one, though im a bit nervous after seeing the new 2012 Duke, that was a step backwards as far as visual appearance.<br>when i saw the first images of the 05 SD i thought it was fantastic, then when the redesigned the 07 it was like they designed it for me, i still love the thing!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SDNerd.svg" alt=SDNerd> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SDNerd</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-12-05 17:27:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>The new 1200/1300 motor is said to be lighter than the existing 990 if so its not going to rev very high or produce a lot more power,<br><br>I would guess at 135 RWBHP Tops, 9000-9500 redline..............................<br><br>I hope not but thats the way its looking to me </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-12-05 21:14:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-12-05 21:41:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SDNerd.svg" alt=SDNerd> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SDNerd</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-12-05 22:28:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>They are using some new forging technique to make the engine cases aren't they?.

Sure it's not the most powerful bike on the road, or the most popular(which is a shame because people don't know what they are missing!) but what it is great back roads burner. Sure a stock one can be a bit twitchy , but that's all taken care of for the most part with some mods and the knowledge of those in this community!<br>What I want on the new ones simple really. How about much better lighting, Let's get a HID standard! A slipper clutch would be great too. I kinda on the fence about more power. I'd like to keep the bike as compact as possible and bigger displacement equals more weight usually. Let's keep the styling hard edged and make it a progression rather than a whole new look with softer lines. Personally I can't stand how generic looking all the litre bikes have become. Keep the mad max look to it. Don't mess up the bike by putting all that electronic crap onto it. No traction control, wheelie control or anything. Why make a hooligan bike tame? I like that French mock up a lot and like others, I'd buy that in a second but who knows how much a reality something like that would be.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/attackthatcorner.svg" alt=attackthatcorner> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">attackthatcorner</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-12-15 12:22:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>exactly! </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/nitrogeoff.svg" alt=nitrogeoff> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">nitrogeoff</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-12-15 23:37:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/attackthatcorner.svg" alt=attackthatcorner> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">attackthatcorner</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-12-16 09:14:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>only one thing to do then:<br><br>how do we get this info to the chief engineer/designer at KTM ???<br><br>do we know anyone there? email? </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-12-16 12:25:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>No need, you can rest assured they are monitoring this thread.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SDNerd.svg" alt=SDNerd> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SDNerd</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-12-16 18:46:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-12-17 01:04:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>The reason I say they are watching the thread is that Dutch met some the KTM guys at a KTM invite weekend in Spain for the RC8R 11 launch.

Many duke are being sold now at much lower prices.When they were 14 g's only a select few bought them and the RC8 at 16-18 G's 20 for the special editions died in the show rooms.When the price fell they sold like crazy.My duke is the best bike I have owned in a long time I wanted one when they were 14 k just could not do it.I got mine for $8500 put a couple of G's in mods and now the surge is gone it's lighter and faster.<br>Then I got the RC8 the power is insane I did the same thing put a pipe dropped a few pounds and gave it some more HP and a nice remap and now I have to gear it down cause I can't use any gears but 2nd unless I want to go to jail.It will cruse at 80 in 2nd .I love both bikes ,but the guys that say if you want to go faster just buy an RC8 have not ridden one.They are so differant The duke is so easy to ride and the RC8 is a true sportbike with all the lack of comfort.Not as bad as some others but when your my age your not going for a super long ride unless you bring your pain meds.If KTM can make the bike like the French one have the low end grunt 0-100 that pushes you eyeballs back in your head they have a winner.We all want that power to come out of a turn with a power wheelie under control.I love those.If they can get the price at 14k or less and offer the mods we all want to do to make our bike personal then I would sell both of mine.to have duke handling riding comfort and RC8 power sign me up.I just think KTM will want 20k and only that small % will be able to buy it even if it is perfect. I guess we just have wait and see.If people can stop losing their jobs and their homes we can get back to buying toys and having fun again.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AGRO.svg" alt="AGRO!"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AGRO!</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-01-08 01:29:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I agree.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AGRO.svg" alt="AGRO!"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AGRO!</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-02-14 13:51:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content><img src="http://www.motorcyclenews.com/upload/287087/images/ktm-superduke-1300.jpg" alt=Image><br><a class=postlink href="http://www.motorcyclenews.com/MCN/News/newsresults/New-bikes/2012/February/feb0312-new-ktm-super-duke-1290-spied/">http://www.motorcyclenews.com/MCN/News/ ... 290-spied/</a><br><br>Read this a couple of days ago, dont know if ya'll are aware of this.<br><br>Peace</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/attackthatcorner.svg" alt=attackthatcorner> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">attackthatcorner</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-02-14 14:42:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content><a class=postlink-local href="http://www.superduke.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=18668">viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=18668</a><br><br> </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/duffman.svg" alt=duffman> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">duffman</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-03-23 13:48:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>if that's what the new one is going to look like, I won't be getting one.
