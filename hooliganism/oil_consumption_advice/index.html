I called a good friend that is a sevvice mgr at a KTM shop.I told him the problem he laughed he told me not to worry that is is bulit into the enginering.That it will burn oil when new for the first few thousands miles.Bucause we use sync oil on a new motor it takes a while for the rings to seat.So when I floged it over 100 mph for hours it burned oil.AS long as your duke runs well and does not burn a tonYour ok. <br><br>My duke would use a half bottle of oil if I did a couple of high speed runs for several hours.<br><br>I just kept an eye on the oil tube and filled it when needed.My bike ran great and still does has plenty of power.<br>I just switched over to the RC8R because I wanted more power and more of a race bike.<br>The duke is a great bike so fun to ride.But I am a big guy and by the time I got all my gear on I was close to 280 lbs so I could only get 135-140 mph.<br>That was just not enough for me.My RC8R can do 150+ in third gear with little effort.<br><br>I was getting tired of getting passed by my M8's on there litre bikes.Now I do the passing.So don't worry unless you feel a loss of power and see a lot of white smoke.and burn a bottle at a time.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Dehumanized.svg" alt=Dehumanized> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Dehumanized</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-03 15:08:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>"So if anyone knows what compression the cylinders should be achieving I would really like to get me hands on that info, additionally any other advice or similar experiences would be much appreciated."<br><br>I do not have any numbers for you but you could check each cylinder for compression and compare to each other.

oil ,first service 500 plus miles it was on the low mark. i was used to the dry sump bikes from using aprilia rsv and tuonos. the first service i moaned and was told ,oh just keep a eye on it .the first 3000 miles on it drank oil ,if i gave it a serious ragging it was worse , motorex is not cheap either .. i used to get stressed about the whole issue ,could smell it burning to,normally after i got off after thrash. i think back it would use 150 ml to a 100 miles ,long rides in top gear 80 + no problem , short rides high revs . drank it. synthetic oil does not help .<br>10 w is a thin oil . as one of the other members said it takes much longer to bed in . i changed oils to 300v motul ,better price for bulk ,so the aprilia got that and the ktm.ha it still used it but not quite as much . 7000 miles later it slowed up burning oil ,would only put in 1/4 of what it did first use ..i sold the bike as i was not sure about the motor in it and had a few other issues with it ,it destroyed the chain and sprockets in no time, tyres would on last a short while . think it was my riding style . i did think the motor would last 20000 miles as my old 640 lc went bang at 12000 miles ,that used oil to .when i sold i wish i never ,best handling bike ever at the time . only bike if you got it all wrong ,it would let you off with a grin .in the last month or two been checking mileages out on the motors on the net .seen a adv 950 with over 80000 miles on it ,motors are good then so now have bought another ktm superduke r to use as a daily work grind,have only got to ride in the wet so far, 300 miles .so now when it uses oil i will just top it up . just need a oil tanker . </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0>
