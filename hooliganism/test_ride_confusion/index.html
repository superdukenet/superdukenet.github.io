Finally scored myself a test ride on the beast, but am more confused about whether I want one than before I rode it! <br><br>Started off the day with a test on the Ducati 899. Great little bike, real gem of a motor that you can actually push on the road within reason and actually get out of 3rd gear, unlike a litre bike. Fantastic around the bends. Only thing was the uncomfortable riding position. Even after 20 mins, whilst tolerable, the pressure on wrists and engine heat were apparent. <br><br>Next up came a good thrashing of the S1000R. Holy shit what a motor! Stonking power, nice quickshifter, great package. But... Bland. Just like every other literbike before it. And I barely got it into third gear. Great bike but one I could never love. <br><br>Then, the beast. It was unlike anything I'd ever ridden. At first I thought it under powered in the first two gears until I started short shifting and riding the torque wave. Laugh out loud addictive! Until I'd get to a corner and it just felt so odd to me. I'm from a sportsbike background and it was a real head f@#k! It kind of feels like a dirt bike being so tall and my brain was screaming a warning not to tip it in too far plus it was hard for me to work out the best body position for cornering. Ass cheek off, knee out sportsbike positioning didn't seem the way to go which left me lacking confidence completely. I really want to love the bike, I just have no idea how to get her around the twisties. Has anyone been through the same dilemma/learning curve? <br><br>The sportsbike rider in me is telling me to suffer the discomfort of the Panigale to enjoy the cornering performance and ego boost riding the best known and best looking brand on the market gives you. But... In between the twisties I'll hit on a Sunday the Katoom is a laugh the duc could never be. I'm really torn. I just have no idea how to get around a corner on the beast.. <br><br>The 899 is the safer choice for me. No doubt the 899 will have better resale, and it also cost less. I'm getting quoted 22000 AUD for the 899 and 25900 for the 1290 OTD in Sydney, Australia. What have other NSW riders been quoted? <br><br>Any help with my big decision would be greatly appreciated. This is the toughest choice I've ever had selecting a new bike. <br><br>Cheers, Adam.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-07-20 02:55:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>G'day mate, same issue here.<br>My current steed is an s1krr.

If your under 40, I'm not. I would go for a sport bike. But that being said. You have to get used to cornering on a naked bike. Your not as close to the ground as you are on a sport bike. One of several reason to go for a fast naked bike is that you don't have to go as fast to have the same fun. The other reason is comfort. And the only reason to choose the 1290r is the motor. It's simply amazingly perfect for the street.<br><br>Btw, have you ridden the RC8r. It's a very fun bike to ride and surprisingly comfortable for being a sport bike. <br><br>P.S. If you don't want loose a lot of money buying a new bike. Don't. No matter which one you buy you will loose 40 to 60% if you keep it for longer than 3 years. So you know Ducatis loose there value too. In fact if you wanted to pick up a good used Ducati. Look for one of the 1098s. You can now pick them up for 60% to 70% of what they cost new.

The 1290, although overpriced and lacking a much needed quickshifter is at the top of my most wanted list. It is a great bike though, just really different to anything else out there and thus hard to come to terms with for me. If I could adapt my riding style to it I think it would be pure magic. Getting on top of all that torque and actually giving it full throttle even half the time on a fast road ride would take my riding to a whole new level. Just interested to see how other guys from sportsbike backgrounds who've made the switch are getting on with it... Kind of just looking for justification to grab one. Or a least grab a spot in a waiting list for one. A long list...

I currently own 2011 zx-10r that I bought new in 2011. It is currently my dedicated track bike(thanks to the duke).<br>My transition to the duke felt almost natural, I can run into corners deeper and come out of them much harder than my 10, the duke holds a line better and just feels better in the twisty's. The power is like "holy shit" it is really rediculous, actually the 10 feels slow compared to it. Of course the duke is more comfy than the 10, the brakes are better on duke and I didn't have to spend 1700.00 on a ohlins rear shock to make the 10 handle/feel better in a corner. I feel the duke is a much better bike out the box than any jap bike. The only real complaint I have about the duke is the slippery foot pegs(they suck). All the complaints about the duke not holding memory, blah who cares(the 10 didn't either till i got it flashed), just reset every time you turn the key. I don't have the loose rear wheel that a lot of folks are complaining about. Honestly at this point I would sell my 10 and buy another duke and track the shit out of it! but I told the wife this a street bike that the both of us could enjoy .Oh the damn speedo being off really sucks and hopefully they come out with some kind of fix for this soon. The duke is deceivingly fast, it doesn't feel like you are going fast until you look down and your 90mph on the highway(witch is actually 81, i guess)<br><br></span>anyway the bike is awesome out of the box and with the help of the aftermarket it will be a super duper duke.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ebags.svg" alt=ebags> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">ebags</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-07-31 05:35:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ma1290rky.svg" alt=ma1290rky> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">ma1290rky</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-07-31 10:05:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Thanks to everyone who has responded. I've had a good deal of time to think over the bikes I test rode. The 899 was pretty, and pretty damn uncomfortable. My lingering memories are of sore wrists, moving around to keep pressure off my lower back, and the tank using my thighs to form an impromptu vice to squash my nuts. The power felt nice. It was the first bike I'd ridden in 3 years. The power felt nice, until I rode the supernakeds... <br><br>The S1000R is a great rational choice. But the only part I truly enjoyed was WOT and that means I'd be going about 150km/ph everywhere. It is super clinical too. <br><br>Then there's the Superduke. I do not think when I recall my ride. I just remember the feeling. The other bikes I rode. The 1290 I rode to the halfway point, laughing maniacally and just couldn't bring myself to turn and head back to the stealership. I rode for another 15 minutes before I begrudgingly threw a u turn. <br><br>No, I do not want to pay 26k for it. No, I do not want to pay an eye popping amount for a full system. The 22k for the S1000R would be much nicer. But then I'd ride the beemer for 200 metres and I'd gladly pay 5k to swap it for the Katoom. I couldn't be happy with another bike currently on the market. <br><br>Yeah, there are a few issues so I'll wait until next year before I put in an order but simply, The Beast is the bike. Unless you've ridden one you wouldn't understand. <br><br>The Beast. If you have to ask, you'll never know.<br><br>Adam.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/scamb66.svg" alt=scamb66> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">scamb66</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-07-31 17:56:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/scamb66.svg" alt=scamb66> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">scamb66</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-07-31 18:43:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Plake.svg" alt=Plake> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Plake</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-07-31 20:16:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Got damn if you like sportbikes like cornering there is no better naked than Tuono V4 !!
