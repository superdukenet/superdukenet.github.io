Both ways work though. <br><br>The problem i found with throttle up is you give it a good crack and as it come up you have to roll the throttle back and time it right to hit the start of the balance/light point, When learning i found this real hard to match it so would end up rolling off too soon and it went down, or not quite nipping it back soon enough and got that huge adrenaline spike as it came up way too high too fast.<br><br>On 1st gear clutch ups i only use about 1/4/ to 1/3rd throttle, just like your accelerating briskly, tinyest slip of the clutch, just enough to break the drive for a split second and it will come up nice and smooth. Its actually easier to just use your left index finger then you have a good secure hold of the bar and it means you cant give it too hard a ping. The beauty of that way is as it comes up you only have to roll the throttle back a tiny amount to keep it there.<br><br>2nd gear is easiest for me when driving hard out a corner and it will rise up, just keep it open and roll off a bit at the desired height. Or clutch up is the same as 1st but it needs a bigger handfull of throttle. Just use the same tiny clutch slip, but because you've got a load of throttle on the revs will rise quickly anyway. Also found you have to be pretty low in the revs for this. I tend to do it through sound but it's prob about 4k and when i clutch it it jumps to 6k for a split second.<br><br>Few little tricks i found is to relax and be loose. <br>Sit up with your ass cheecks just touching where it rises for the pillion pad. (i see you have an R so prob just slide back a bit). <br>Make sure rear sag an shock damping setting are right for you beign a big lad, too soft and it squats and absorbs the wheelie. <br>Try and sit up and kinda bring the bike to you. I had a bit of eureka moment when i couldn't get it up in 2rd but caught a glimpse of my shadow on the road to the side and saw everytime i clutched it i automatically leaned forward for some strange reason. Stopped that and it shot up easily </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/THEDUKE.svg" alt=THEDUKE> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">THEDUKE</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-07-12 07:45:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>no mark it wasnt me mate.<br><br>cheers for the info viking, i have also noticed that i automatically lean forward too for some strange reason? i think its cos of the horror storys that clutching comes up violent and hard so im trying to tame it before it even comes up . why do you say it needs to be low down in the revs around 4k? then jump it to 6kish when clutch is pulled in? also when the im releasing the clutch do i just drop it or release as though im setting off? and do i keep accelerating through the drop/release of the clutch?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Viking.svg" alt=Viking> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Viking</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-07-12 09:22:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Eat less cake, </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Dutch.svg" alt=Dutch> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Dutch</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-07-12 09:30:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/THEDUKE.svg" alt=THEDUKE> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">THEDUKE</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-07-12 10:15:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>It's just a tiny flick, hardly any movement really. If you riding along all your looking to do is nip the lever in only just enough to make the revs rise, so only just nipping to the bite point. Your not disengageing the clutch totally and banging it back out. Think of it like a wheelie switch. If you are at 10mph in 1st and open the gas 1/3rd it will drive forward. All your aiming to do is just nip that clutch lever in enough to just hit the bite point for a split second and release. <br><br>I'm typing from my phone here, but if you jump onto YouTube and look for an MCN vid of how to wheelie it shows it there. It's harder to explain in text, once you hear it you'll get it everytime. It's like roll on braaaaaaa, wee tiny flick, brAAA, waa, then wee nips on the throttle to keep it there. I explain of in 1st coz that's the easiest and most gentle. In 2nd you have to give it a bigger handful of gas, same little clutch ping, bit coz its under a lot more load it will shoot up the revs quicker. <br><br>I'm still learning myself. Can only hold it up through a single gear just now. My slow mind is struggling a bit to match Tue gear change/ wee throttle snap to change up and keep it there. Always a bit nervous of getting back on the gas too hard once it's up a gear and flipping so it always just comes down after the gear change and tapers out into a long semi power wheelie. <br><br>Really though, if you can loft it high in 2nd and hold it there for a few hundred yards or so its gonna be good enough to get a good buzz and impress any bystanders. Some guys just have natural balance and can stunt easy. Guys like us have to take baby steps and build it up slowly. Jeees, its took me a year of practice(on another bike though), just to reach his level. <br><br>Cracking advice from the guy earlier though.<br><br>There's a few wheelie haterz on here though mate. The anti wheelie police will be on here shortly LOL.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Dutch.svg" alt=Dutch> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Dutch</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-07-12 10:53:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I seem to have a wheelie cutout switch built into my right hand, but it only works on the SDR.<br><br>I learned on to wheelie on a 625SMC - which was easy in second off the power, and then I learned to clutch it up, which was more controllable and less violent.

Just take your time and build up slowly. Even if it takes a year then its a year of experience and you'll be better as time goes on.<br><br>If you check out the pics I posted earlier in the thread. When the headlamp is up in your line of sight that's the start of the balance point.

It's a lot gentler and easier to control. <br><br>Rather than put yourself under pressure, try practicing when your out on a run.

Super chuffed for you. Knew you'd get it, but its hard to explain on the internet. I went out with a mate today, real good hard run, found a straight and had some practice where we rode alongside and he could see exactly what my hands were doing. Once you get an ear for the revs and ping you'll get it everytime.<br><br>As for changing up. This is the stage I'm at now too. I'm finding though that rather than change up I'm getting it higher in 2nd and not quite acceleration through the gear at fast. I think its all about air time. More time spent up high, more relaxed you'll be with it. Can lift it at 30mph in 2nd and hold it up smooth all the way through. Even got time to give the bars a wee twist to the right and have to twist my head a bit to see past the speedo. Goal is to have it up there smooth and pretty much holding a constant speed as possible rather that accelerating through it. Tried going 1st to 2nd a few times and hit neutral and I can tell ya, it comes down quick when you do that </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/THEDUKE.svg" alt=THEDUKE> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">THEDUKE</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-07-31 08:39:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Cheers dude, its a great feeling when you have worked at it for a few weeks and then it just all comes together and you think "why couldn't I do that the first time".<br><br>I'd like to get mine higher and run them for longer in second but my reason for changing up to third is that its supposed to be less snatchy when its up which I think will make for a smoother and longer wheelie? <br><br>Ideally I'd like to be able to pop and run a long 1 in second then click into third and carry it on......<br><br>Supose its same as before, practice, practice......practice!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Jermo.svg" alt=Jermo> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Jermo</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-08-03 18:04:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Let's kick this topic up again, I know you guys don't mind because Superdukes love wheelies <br><br>I need a little advice:<br>My question is about shifting gears during wheelies.
