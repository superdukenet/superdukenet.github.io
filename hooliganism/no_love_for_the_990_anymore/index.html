Love this bike after 6 years - no thought of changing! <br><br>Been out this morning in the cold and wet, sliding about on summer tyres without TC or ABS. <br><br>The new 1290 changes nothing for me really, so far the threads on this bike are very uninteresting read as most of the posts are by people who haven't ridden the bike and so are no more informed than the previous 12 months of speculation and no one seems to like it when the journos criticise the less than well thought out electronic package. With a few notable exceptions I wish all those that actually own the bike would try to write something about what it's actually like to ride and own rather than just use expletives to wax lyrical about the power and torque, (to probably justify the £12,000 they just shelled out). <br><br>What I really want is for one of the old hand forum 990 members to get one and give us a real assessment of the two bikes. I'm sure that the 1290 is so many light years ahead of the old bike in many ways. But in the real world, on British roads what difference does all that power and torque really make to the enjoyment of riding and hooning about? I really want to know. Is it worth at least double/triple the money compared to buying a well sorted 990?<br><br>I'm still trying to get a demo ride sorted at the local KTM dealer but so far they don't have one available yet.

Will that translate to a more enjoyable rie on the road? Probably not as you can only go so fast before you are a danger to yourself and others as some of the videos that have been posted up by new owners clearly show (there is a time and a place to go fast on the street and 100mph in the middle of a city is not it...disaster waiting to happen really).<br><br>The real attraction of the new supernakeds to me is the additional power for the track. I will not go any faster on the street but would like the extra poke out of the corners and down the straights on the track to shake those pesky sportbikes so I don't have to do it all on the brakes and in the corners. Best of both worlds.<br><br>And, as CEREC1 mentions, there are some interesting alternatives to the 1290...cheaper options that justify a closer look.

There is no logic or consideration of practicality in my motorcycle purchase decisions!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/No47.svg" alt="No. 47"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">No. 47</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-14 19:52:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Reb.svg" alt=Reb> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Reb</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-14 20:17:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MrK.svg" alt=MrK> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">MrK</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-14 20:22:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AGRO.svg" alt="AGRO!"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AGRO!</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-14 20:46:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>No love lost here for me - aiming for 100k miles before swapping out engine.<br><br>Will be a both/and not either/or for me but still waiting for confirmation that I've won a free 1290 for the spring before spending £14k plus.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DucatiPete.svg" alt="Ducati Pete"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Ducati Pete</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-14 20:47:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Love my 990 and wont be letting it go anytime soon.

My times are on Sports Timing Services for a ref for tracks the series missed out, Oulton, Anglesey, Donington National, Rockingham etc. Lingas times will be somewhere for the Oz guys.

I'm not hating, I've bitched about this before, I want those who have one to be happy but I won't be surprised if someone humiliates the Monstrosity both on road and on track with a lesser machine.<br><br>If you're that worried about tyre shine, take a fooking drill and sanding pad and scrub the tyres in manually then you have no excuses. I dunno.

Thanks for the lecture though. I may have implied but did not state. Check your facts first buddy. I would say I've been fair. You've taken this opportunity to beat down on me with no merit. Was it the shiny tyres comment that upset you so much?<br><br>Stop whining about the weather &amp; road conditions, all I was saying was that the 1290's features are making up for its shortfalls. If you ain't got the ability, why waste time dreaming? I would love to ride it and give a fair appraisal but as I've spent 2.5 the amount of the 1290 on litigation defending my rejection I would say I'm demonstrating the integrity you clearly lack.<br><br>I'm trying to fix this tank problem, as you have reported a problem first hand and done nothing to contribute that would make you capital hypocrite.<br><br>As for your "stating the obvious" crap, perhaps you should take the time to read things properly first &amp; without prejudice. I never said I'm the better rider, my comment was aimed at chassis feel &amp; feedback.<br><br>Did I really come across as hostile? Or is Herr Klinck just covering for his inadequacies by acting a prick? There are others who haven't taken a shine to the 1290 either but you haven't taken it upon yourself to persecute them have you? Whereas I have a legitimate reason to pissed with KTM.

If I did I would buy the 1290 and a 950 and a 390 and a 640 and a 690. I have a 990 and I like it. I rode mine yesterday to the paint store to get some color samples for a customer. What A great runabout. I have been troubled by the sick economy and with such it has helped me greatly appreciate the things that have not needed to leave the garage since the word builder became a swear word around these parts. I swore that the SD would be the last two wheeled entertainment to receive a for sale sign stuck to its side panel and so far, knock on wood, it remains. This year was the first year since all you bastards quit hiring carpenters that the term expendable income has snuck back into my pair o dimes. I will use this money to play on the wheels I have and room additions willing in the future I will start thinking about more numbers with a smile that 990 still graces my shop floor. I want an old BMW GS pre fuel injection.<br>I wonder if the introduction into the new SD will open aftermarket sales of removed upgrades?<br>We aint got no excuses for pent up frustration over weather and pissy ass attitudes. The weather has been good enough to start fires in campouts and ride our SD's any time any where. The trouble seems to stem from not having an SD to ride. </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/BassAgent.svg" alt=BassAgent> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">BassAgent</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-18 05:48:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Lowrance.svg" alt=Lowrance> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Lowrance</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-18 06:17:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-18 07:38:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TLSRuss.svg" alt=TLS_Russ> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TLS_Russ</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-18 08:07:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I've spent the last week having an hour or two in the garage giving my bike the best clean and fettle it's had for several years. The weather is so bad here that even I can't face going out in it. Roads flooded round my area now, yesterday they were well over the top of the car wheels getting the kids to nursery. There is no bike in the world that could cope with a ride out there at the moment. <br><br>3. Still trying to find a nice set of after-market rear wheel adjusters that are more accurate than the OE stuff. At the right price, well made and black, (NOT ORANGE!!!)<br><br>4. I need to get my rear shock off and get the spring re-powder coated as all the orange paint has started to flake off badly. It looks like an old tractor suspension - the worst victim of several British salty winters. Black it will be then. The only token orange left on the bike will be the rev counter graphics. Actually last night I was checking out whether I could replace the red kill switch with a black replacement because I don't really see why the switch needs to be red. Why are they?!!!<br><br>5. After convincing myself that I am now permanently happy with clip-on handle bars I need to find a way to remount my Scotts damper so that I can dispense with the risers it currently attaches to. Need to do a drawing of a component with the right holes and thread so that the damper can be fixed directly onto the top triple clamp and then also get it machined up along with the frame bracket modified to suit. I also maybe will look at getting a handle bar mirror because riding about with no mirrors at all does make for a lot of having to crane your neck round all the time and it's not good for motorway riding. (I just don't like the way they stick out and ruin the way the bike looks)<br><br>6. One day I will find some carbon wheels that I can afford!<br><br>7. Long term I'm still planning to work on a cafe-racer version of the SD. I want to start with a one-off aluminium tank, get rid of the tank fairings look and create a more retro single seat set up. Along with this I wanted to have a go at getting a short single silencer and loose the twin underseat pipes. Still looking for an old RC8 tank to see if that's a possible starting point but need to find one at the right price.<br><br>8. Maybe I will buy another 990 to do this project on. Like Dribble says I expect that there will be a gradual increase in parts coming onto the market this year which may open up opportunities. Over the years I have bought nearly all my parts through ebay or this forum but the last few years there has been virtually nothing for sale - the market has been really sparse for anything interesting. I still look everyday though.<br><br>Keeping busy!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14

problems but they are possible to resolve, 104mm is the limit at which you can keep the pistons the same weight as stock and the other important thing is not to increase the maximum rpm, within those limitations reliability should not be an issue, the base gasket problem seems to be mostly with bikes that are tracked on lowered gearing and run at maximum rpms, having much stronger cylinder studs

I am still a newcomer to the 990, so I am not even remotely tempted by the 1290.

Better to be a mosquito than an elephant, but maybe that is a bad analogy for the Super Dukes... or is it? For the guys who know how to ride these bikes on a track, I can see the appeal of the beast.

He also had reworked with new internals and shims and it had been used and adjusted frequently, (as you would expect), so there were always a lot of marks and scratches round the screw adjusters and collar. I think the spring paint had already got a few cracks starting when I got it so this is just four years worth of winter salt doing it's business - no amount of cleaning and washing can stop this once the damp gets under the paint.<br><br>Rest of the bike is not like this although it is showing all it's years of wear both from all year riding and track crashes and gravel scaring. I keep on top of the corrosion really and replace any nuts and bolts that get past it. There's not that much bare steel on the SD, most of the parts are alloy or have a lot of black paint finish and so far there is no peeling paint. The only place I can think of is the part that attaches one of the water cooling tubes to the radiator. That's flaking paint and gone rusty. Parts that are bare steel have all gone rusty at some time or other and I just keep on cleaning and oiling to keep it all at bay. Oil feed line running underneath left side of engine, drain bolt head underneath oil tank, exhaust studs, bolt heads on rear disc, etc. All these go rusty if left. Engine finish is perfect with no flaking or anything. But it's a bastard to get all the road grime off and keep looking clean. Maybe the grey has started to take on a yellowish tinge over the years, it's not the best of colours - one day I will do a big engine overhaul and get all the cases made black, (as it should have been as standard).<br><br>Generally KTMs are finished really well and designed for hard work and abuse. Maybe the finish is not like high-end, shiny and perfect, but they do last and are not fragile and cheap. I've no interest in shiny paint and chrome.

It is the only bike I have ever had with no foreseable intention of selling. In 30 years I have owned most of the latest and greatest bikes in their day, then traded them for the newest latest and greatest pretender that replaced them. I have owned faster bikes, more technologically better equipped bikes, certainly more comfortable bikes but somehow these are all my 'bits on the side'. Furthermore, my selection criteria for these 'bits on the side' is "how will it fit with my SDR?". I have spent money on the SDR until there is almost nothing left to improve, it still isnt perfect but wouldnt it be boring if it were?<br><br>Just like the naggy old, post menopausal, witch I live with; I see newer brighterbetter specced models daily and yet,I still come home to my Superduke.
