I've posted my intro. in it's proper forum and I've posted my silly story of my three year wait in the "superduke wannbee's" (Addiction) section of the forum. Today I picked up the SD at the dealer, took a couple hours due to his crappy printer/copier being on the fritz but hey, I've already been waiting three years what's a couple more hours anyway, right? <br> <br> Although I cannot give such an in depth review as topenz did, I can pretty much agree with everything he says about the new ride. <br> <br>The bike is currently not registered or insured so my first ride was somewhat brief and mild mannered. <br> <br>To do the comparison with the S1 Buell I'll start by saying a few things about my expectations as a comparison between two in my minds eye on my first ten minutes riding.

K. I'm back, sorry for the inconvienience of leaving you mid story. The S1 Buell I had was a 1998 model, probably closer to the Superduke in terms of it's designed fuction (read hooligan vehicle) than anything else. Steel trellis type frame, strange but comfy ergos, light , agile and nimble characteristics. Then the factory screwed it all up with the X1 alloy framed version that no longer had the sex appeal of the early "steel tubers" but that's a story for another forum. <br> <br>I've always had unusual bikes in my fleet with the S1 actually being the most "common" of the unusual. Like the SD, I was smitten by it's looks and design when it was first released to the public. It took a few years, but it eventually found it's home my garage. The bike was picked up with 1305 miles on the clock and it already had the Buell performance kit installed. I believe this to be a S.S. header and lightwieght muffler (can) a carbon-fibre free breathing air filter and a different ignition module. It also had the optional PM alloy wheels. Needless to say, the bike really ripped for somethng with an archaic pushrod engine! Yes, deep down I know it's still a Harley stepchild, but it was at least a stepchild with badass attitude. <br> <br>This was to be the Baseline for my SD comparison. Performance was as described: <br>BUELL; first gear clutchless power only wheellies were effortless. Second gear shifted near redline was always good for an impressive wheelie as well. Slow rolling second gear wheelies you just needed to be around 1900-2000 rpm when you jumped on the throttle. As you can see I don't use the clutch to force a wheelie. At least Harley torque was good for something <br> <br>OK off on my first ride as I talk to myself in my mind. Please keep in mind a few facts; <br> <br>#1) As I take this ride the bike is not legally registed nor is it insured at this time. <br> <br>#2) I am a mechanic by trade. Floging the crap out of an engine does great things to wear it in PROVIDED YOU ARE RACING, for those of us who don't feel the need for seasonal rebuilds EASING these same parts to wear in at a slower pace WILL ALLOW THE MOTOR TO LAST LONGER, MUCH LONGER in the end. No need to argue here folks I've aready seen the other thread. This break in method is MY OPINION so save your comments <br> <br>#3) It is about only 2 degrees out. Of course I mean 2 C. This site is euro after all. (sorry about any earlier references to miles etc.) <br> <br> Upon start-up the fuel injection burps the beast to life in an effortless manner. The motor spins over and fires immediately, runs a bit of a high idle(of which you folks prepared me for) and then settles to a reasonable idle like purr. AIR COOLED CARBed BUELL ; Down 1 point. <br> <br> Clutch in ( easy pull pretty much like the Buell although the hydro clutch has a little less pull effort) click into gear, slight "ker chunk" which for a brand new bike from my experience is not unusual at all. Let clutch out and feel that little grabitty grab grab from idle ( yes it's still there on the USA 07's as well) I don't see this as a fault, I believe it to be simply getting used to a hydro clutch. So far so good, I am impressed with the smoothness of the entire bike so far. Everything is silky smooth as far as controls etc. Keep in mind it is 2C outside and the fuel injection immediately has this motor ready to work. AIR COOLED BUELL spits farts and chuffs until it's warm and ready to work. Big Grin BUELL Down 2 Points. <br> <br>Slowy bring the virgin up to speed (me or the bike you can use your imagination here ) and run through all the gears including that extra one on top. A six speed now puts BUELL Down 3 points. The transmisson shifts beautifully silky smooth. Here's where you expect me to also deduct againt the Buell, but not in my case. For some reason the tranny in the Buell shifted extremely well although I am very aware that most don't. Plus I've owned and ridden many Harleys, so I was already familiar that it shifted better than it typically should. <br> <br> So I've run up and down the gears done some bumpy back roads and small secondary hi ways generally light with a little traffic. Overall impression so far keeps coming back to how smooth everything operates. I've still yet to wack the throttle as I'm taking my time figuring what the functions and buttons of the dash panel do. Oh look at the clock and temp ! and other useful info! BUELL with tach/speedo , N light and other bare bones functions lose another point. Down 3. <br> <br> Alright, I know to take it easy but lets do a little jump on the throttle here. Ahhhh.... a little short of what I was used to. The Buell had gobs of instantaneous power down here, believe it or not I'm kind of disappointed at this feel of gutlessness at the very bottom. SD Down 1 point! WTF is this for real? Please remember, I am reflecting the thoughts as I had them during my ride here. OK somethings not right here . Everybody on the web says this bike kicks arse and is a wheelie prone hooligan's ride. Apparently this many people making this statement tells me the power is somewhere else. Time to do a mild power run. For those not in the know, The Buell is a geared low fast revving sportster engine which revs quick for a pushrod motor which is a great power match for it's lightweight chassis, but unfortunately the low gears which make it so much fun also cause it to max out at only about 107-110 MPH . Buell down 1 more point. <br> <br> So, as I come to the famous "1 mile, straight as you can see, no police presence" section of the road, I continue to roll the throttle back. I figure a little slight minor flogging will reveal something here. AND REVEAL IT DOES. All of the stump pulling power the Buell had is still here on the SD but comes on in a much more tame manner a little higher up on the chart. But the difference here is that when it comes on IT JUST KEEPS ON PILING IT ON. <br> <br>Brake Test: Anyone who has ever Ridden an S1 can atest to the brakes. Although I firmly believe my Buell had a superior braking system completely in line with the KTMs I wondered why it is neccesary for the dual set-up on the front.I can only assume that that was all you need to slow down from 107-110 MPH. Perhaps the faster SD just plain NEEDS more braking from top speeds to justify the twin rotors. <br> <br>ANYWAY, the bottom line is this. I will miss the badarse bark of the Buell and the instant bottom end power delivery, but I can already tell once I break this in it will be the absolute balls to ride. I bought this bike to be different; And boy is it! I like they way it will always stand out from the crowd of mainstream cookie cutter bikes. I took it in orange to be: Different , and to standout even more from the crowd (maybe Dr.F just wants to go by so fast he isn't associated with any crowd ) <br> <br>Well that's it folks. I know it's a bit long, but with all the good things that have already been said on this forum it left me little to comment on other than my first ride impressions. Some of you stated I won't regret the decision to part with the Buell , But In a way I already have. Of the 17 motorcycles I've purchased, it was the first one I've ever sold. Yep, I've still got fifteen left! <br> OH yeah, whooo whooo, hubba hubba dooo what summer is ahead for me! Thanks for the kind remarks ,this forum has a nice tone to it with some very sociable and friendly members. You have already welcomed me here and I now glad to be among the owners group.

Good to see you like your SD and you're just scratching the service being brand new. <br> <br>The much smaller, (ultra) short stroke LC8 twin will never give the low-end stomp of the huge air-cooled long stroke HD tractor engine. That shouldn't be a surprise. But then, that's about the only thing it's capable of. A well sorted SD pulls 100Nm of torque around 6 - 6.5K. That's not far off a Buell, only at 3 times the RPM. <br> <br>If you've not do it already, fit a 16T front sprocket. It transforms the feel of the bike IMO. <br> <br>Richard.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/KTMax.svg" alt=KTMax> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">KTMax</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2007-04-08 13:53:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Plipton.svg" alt=Plipton> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Plipton</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2007-04-08 14:33:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/KTMax.svg" alt=KTMax> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">KTMax</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2007-04-08 17:11:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
