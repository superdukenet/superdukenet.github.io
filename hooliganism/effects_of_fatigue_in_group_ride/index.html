The group consisted of about 20 people with the regular layout of fast riders in the front and newer riders in the back. To make a long story short, near the end to the ride I noticed more and more mistakes from riders, myself included. I can honestly tally these mistakes to rider fatigue due to the heat. All came out unscathed, but could have resulted in major injuries, or even a fatality. The first incident occurred when going along a two lane road at about 70 mph that eventually necked down to a one lane with the first turn to be taken at about 25 mph. One of the riders did not take note of the sign and almost lost control to get slowed down in time. The second incident occurred when another rider did not slow down, despite the rumble strips on the ground warning riders to slow down due the stop sign right after the blind crest, and almost ran into the back of the stopped group. She managed to avoid the group by going into the other lane, but ended up crossing two lanes of Hwy 1. Luckily for her, there was no oncoming traffic, or else it would've ended badly. The group eventually split right after that with most riders opting to take the straight shot home via freeway. The remaining group, 4 of us, continued on the twisties to get us home. I was leading the group and made a mistake due to not concentrating on this tight winding road and almost rode off the side of the mountain. I slowed my pace shortly after and made it home safely. Needless to say, I learned to not override your limits when fatigued. I have ridden these roads in the past faster than I was going that day, but due to fatigue, I overrode my limits.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SDNerd.svg" alt=SDNerd> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SDNerd</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-09-21 19:59:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Not sure the point of the thread. I could probably recount virtually this exact story from personal experience. And a few with the added note or two about where people died, or were paralyzed.<br><br>Well known amongst experts and experienced riders: Heat, fatigue, and perhaps most commonly, <span style="font-weight: bold">dehydration</span> - even mild - lead to substantially decreased concentration. Thrown in a large group of people, which WILL have a wide range of experience, and more than one is inevitably going to get in over their head. Which results in crashing. Its statistics - in the years I've ridden, the likelihood of a crash for a ride the duration of one tankful or more, seems to exponentially increase as function of the number of riders on the "ride".<br><br>Ask any race/performance/rider coach. They will tell you that they don't do big group rides, and they will tell you these very same reasons why.<br><br>Its extremely rare that I would ride with a group bigger than 6. And its usually with people I know, have ridden with often, and trust. And I would readily do a 400+ mile day with anyone I regularly ride with - no matter how warm. They stay hydrated. They know when to take a break. They know when to eat. And they know when they are in over their head - and just slow down or go home. And they don't crash. At least, its extremely rare.<br><br>Riding with large packs of strangers leads to nothing but a bad day.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/StupidLuke.svg" alt="Stupid Luke"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Stupid Luke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-09-21 20:55:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I rode with about 20 from here a few times.

That or lead a smaller group of people who want to survive the day. And detour if it's getting ridiculous. And if I can't maintain control of the group in some semblance of order I gladly oblige the asshats and let them wander away, not knowing the route. The rest of us can alter the route and make sure we don't see them again.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">120 miles?</span> That's hardly enough to put the gear on and ride.
