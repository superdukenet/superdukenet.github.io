Still other times, and this has only happened a couple of times, I take off and WHAM! the thing flat out pulls a real wheel stand, happens very fast and seemingly right off the bat, it is very surprising and i have to get off the throttle to avoid ending up on my but. <br><br>Same goes for second gear, sometimes i can tell it is floating the front wheel, other times it only seems to raise the front a bit. Keep in mind this is all throttle, I have not tried to "make" it wheelie using the clutch or pulling on the bars just cause it is so unpredictable. <br><br>I know the first response that just about everyone will give is to "get it mapped", and i am working on that, waiting on a cable <br>I also have a 40 tooth sprocket on order as well. <br><br>But I am wondering why it is so hit or miss? The "snatchyness" i have read so much about has never visited me, there is a tiny bit of it at low load around 3k, but seems to run without a hickup at full throttle. I also think the altitude here is killing a good chunk of power, but does not explain the randomness. <br><br>I have read several places on this forum about guys pulling power wheelies in 2nd and 3rd gear, and that 1st gear wheelies should never be a problem unless the rider is a sumo wrestler and laying on the tank.....<br><br>the other thing i think is a bit strange, with the air box and cans, i was worried that it would actually run worse without a map, but every mod i have made seems to have hellped, not hindered the performance, I attributed this to the altitude, where it was possibly running rich in stock form so it had some headroom. I am not sure how the BARO sensor works with this FI system, so that may not be the case. <br><br>living in a small town in colorado, a dyno is hard to come by, so no way to tell for sure. anyone else have issues similar to this?<br><br>I will be fitting a wide band O2 sensor to it in the near future just to verify the map tuning, hopefully that will shed some light on things.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DucatiPete.svg" alt="Ducati Pete"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Ducati Pete</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-08-17 22:41:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Can you wheelie?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/joey120373.svg" alt=joey120373> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">joey120373</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-08-17 23:07:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>@ ducati Pete, <br><br>Yes, I can wheelie. problem is not so much technique, but rather the fact that i never know what will happen when i cob the throttle. if i did not care about wrecking it it wouldnt be a big deal, but i do care <br><br>Yes, if i revved the engine, popped the clutch, stood on the rear pegs, pulled back etc etc it would wheelie every time. but since it is never consistent it makes it impossible to learn a repeatable routine, and it also makes me not want to push it, as there have been a few times when it poped up seemingly out of nowhere, if it were to do that and i were "trying" to wheelie, a wreck would most certanly ensue.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MrZ32.svg" alt=MrZ32> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">MrZ32</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-08-17 23:49:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>If you are consistently at that altitude you can probably get away with running the standard map. At your altitude the akra map would just dump way too much fuel causing lack lustre performance. Try removing the secondary shafts as it could be these the are not opening up correctly or test by setting the to100% open at all revs. The other thing map be that you tps could be loose or faulty. <br><br>The tps is the sensor that tells the motor how "open" your throttle is and then calculates based on the percentage of open throttle with the rpm how much ignition and fuel to use. An incorrectly set up tps will cause a snatchy throttle too. There are plenty of people who have smoothened up their bikes by limiting the effect that the tps has on the bike (02 sensors, etc...) but setting up the tps for your bike will make the biggest difference.<br><br>There are ball park figures for the return voltages but every bike seems to vary with what feels right... Its all trial and error and it has scared some people off it as if you get it wrong it turns the bike into a pig...
