Loved the 990 soo much, I decided to take the plunge as soon as a saw the 1290 in the shop!<br><br>So since owning, I've managed to half master power wheelies (in quiet areas with 0 people or cars of course). But they never felt right. I could pop the RGV up to its balance point in first quite easily, and keep it there (but the wind would move me sideways quite often across a lane, so had to be mindful (didn't master leaning whilst on one wheel). But since owning the 1290, didn't have the balls to clutch it up.<br><br>So decided today was the day. <br><br>Satnav from Old street to Sevenoaks - swung by Brands Hatch and watch some classic open wheelers from the 60's (wasn't intended, but hey, was there... After leaving found a quite piece of road that was level with nice bitumen, and got practicing.<br>About 8 mini pops later around 1/2 a foot, I managed to do something different, and BaNG! Balance point!! I was letting the clutch leaver slip out - I think I was releasing it which was slower.<br><br> Foot cover brake..foot cover brake. <br><br>Another 7-10 times and I've nailed it. Nice little 2nd and 3rd gears clutch pops for about 150-200 metres. Easily in 3rd but I prefer 2nd, since I get hit the balance point around 30mph. And hey... Slow moving balance point wheelies - rock.<br>Not gonna get cocky though. Going to keep practicing these for another 2-3 weeks, then start learning to pop in 1st and keep wheelie under 15-20 mph and steady. Never really done the last one, so will be entering this one with great care.<br><br>I know wheelies might not be everyone's cup of tea, and some might think they are dangerous. Course they are, so don't f£&amp;ok around learning on busy London streets. You'll hurt yourself, but probably someone else first... Where there's people and the unexpected, don't risk people's lives. Hit an empty road. If you muck up too, it saves you from embarrassment </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/oczer79.svg" alt=oczer79> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">oczer79</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-09-28 17:45:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Pictures or it didn't happen </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Danimal27.svg" alt=Danimal27> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Danimal27</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-09-28 18:09:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>ill find one on the gopro' memory.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/HYPERMOTO.svg" alt=HYPERMOTO> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">HYPERMOTO</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-09-29 05:16:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I love wheelies also. I found for the best and longest wheelies are 3rd gear. Mine will power up by twisting the throttle but not the best method for riding them a long way. I never do them in first. Way to slow. I get to between 60 to 70 mph in 3rd, pull in the clutch and pin it wide open and dump the clutch to get it up good. After that just play with the throttle and ride it out. Lots of people here brag about their little 2 inch wheelies. LOL!<br>I did change to a 16T front sprocket. Something else that really helped was suspension settings. When I got the bike it would not wheelie in 3rd, the suspension was WAY to soft since I weigh 220lbs. I set everything to sport settings in the book and tightened the rear shock preload 3 full turns. That made the huge difference.....</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Stratkat.svg" alt=Stratkat> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Stratkat</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-09-29 11:44:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Yeah wheelies are all part of normal riding as far as I am concerned, I started on dirt bikes 37 years ago and the instincts are still the same.<br><br>Whenever I get the chance up it comes! Can't beat it.<br><br>I posted this on another thread so for what it's worth this is my method:<br><br><br>I often have this conversation with my mates and there is always a difference of opinion on what constitutes a "wheelie" but for what it's worth I will share my own opinion. It is true to say that my 1290 will happily lift the front over a crest in 4th or 5th but I don't really class that as a "wheelie as it is just hovering about 1 or 2 feet above the tarmac. If it came up high I would find it difficult to settle it in and maintain it over a distance. My method is to set off as normal in first gear accelerating gently then when I am ready to change into second I shut the throttle a fraction before pulling in the clutch which dips the front slightly then I shift into second and whack open the throttle and dump the clutch simultaneously using the rebound of the forks to send the front skyward up to the balancing point, when I am settled in (only a few seconds) I select third then when settled into third I select fourth and enjoy the ride for as long as I can keep it up. I never look at the speedo and I ALWAYS keep my foot over the rear brake just in case it gets past the balancing point and I have a slight chance of saving it albeit at the expense of a set of head bearings and bruised bollocks! I haven't been able to get it into 5th yet but I will keep trying<br>I am sure that this method won't suit everyone but it has worked for me for 30 plus years on pretty much everything wether it's a 125 dirt bike or a 1000 superbike.<br>One thing I have noticed on this bike is that the front wheel stops spinning virtually as soon as I get it up to the balancing point so even if you only manage a short wheelie the front tyre makes a lot of noise when it makes contact with the tarmac. My only worry is that one day I will land it on some oil or diesel and it will have me off!!<br><br>It's all about having "FUN" </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Danimal27.svg" alt=Danimal27> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Danimal27</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-09-29 12:57:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Danimal27.svg" alt=Danimal27> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Danimal27</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-09-29 13:54:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Yep that was me <br>My bike was so soft from the dealer it would not wheelie in 3rd. Now that it is set up for my weight it is a different animal. Yes there are lots of people that think because they pick the front wheel up a inch in 4th they are doing roll on power wheelies. I can ride my bike pretty descent for just turning 700 miles. I should have it down 100% with about 1000 more miles of riding. I did change the sprocket to make it more torquey but the main reason was to get the 6th gear ratio down so I can use it. I see beginners ride all the time that think they are hot because they do a 3 inch high wheelie for 10 feet. I think the Dukes have lots of real riders and also a bunch of guys that are scared to death to push the bikes.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Danimal27.svg" alt=Danimal27> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Danimal27</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-09-29 15:26:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="about.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="terms.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
