It had LeoVince SBK's on it and a PCIII, but otherwise stock. Given that it was winter, I wasn't able to actually ride it until last weekend. I was pretty disappointed with the bike initially, as the ride was very harsh, skittish handling, and way too loud! Power was only so-so, but with that brutal noisy exhaust, I doubt I ever got it to 7500 rpm. Then I decided to rip out the PCIII and put the stock exhaust back on. <br><br>Holy crap! It had double the power, and with the (too) quiet stock exhaust back on, and the PCIII off, I was able to play around at more reasonable (&gt;5000 - 9000) rpms. The prior owner who set up the PCIII obviously didn't know what he was doing. Probably loaded the richest map he could find, then lost interest when there was no power. The suspension adjustments were way off as well - I counted 0 clicks of rebound on one fork, and 12 on the other. The rear adjustments were just screwed to the stops as well! I'm getting that sorted, but after going with "comfort" settings initially, I'm very pleased to see the level of actual adjustability. I'm hoping to find some quiet inserts for the LeoVinces, because the stock pipes are just too quiet. <br><br>So, other than the O2 eliminator I've left in, and the evap canister I've left off, the bike is stock. I have been reading posts on this board all winter, and now that this bike is EXACTLY what I want, I need to ask about one particular mod: The airbox.<br><br>I'm in Canada, and the Rottweiler and Motohooligan kits are similar costs (once you factor in SAS block off plates, etc.) It seems that they are both nice products, but the Rottweiler has seemed to gain favour with many members because it is supposedly much less $$ that the Motohooligan, carbon fiber base plate, etc. I'd have to guess that they are both similar with respect to noise levels, but are not too loud at cruise (like during the commute to work). I'd really like to know if these products are essentially equal, given how close they are in cost. I don't care about extracting every last bit of power (did that with my Hayabusa - now sold) but looking for rideability - keeping a solid mid range, etc, etc.<br><br>Any comments suggestions would be highly appreciated!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-26 12:13:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Welcome.<br><br>It must have been running really badly to gain power by putting the stock exhaust back on especially with adding another 7 or 8 kg! <br><br>I'm not sure if you can buy baffles from Leo Vince separately but it would be worth starting a thread in the 'Wanted' section on here as people may have them lying around. I keep mine in case I have a run-in with the law and should you find them too quiet chopping 2 or 3 inches off the inside makes quite a difference. <br><br>I have the Motohooligan box with 2nd flies removed and at cruising speeds and steady throttles it's barely louder than normal but open the throttle fully and you know about it! </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/StupidLuke.svg" alt="Stupid Luke"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Stupid Luke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-26 14:22:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Thanks for the suggestions and comments. I have an unanswered query with Leo Vince, and hope to hear back regarding the availability of baffles for my system. I agree that the bike was completely off with respect to mapping. I'd had great results with mapping my Hayabusa, but found that the usual tendancy is for people to put a pipe on, and fatten up the fuelling to make more power, which has never worked for me. The Superduke stock is much quicker than as it had been delivered to me. Now I want to open things up properly. Raising the midrange torque is what I'd like to accomplish more than outright HP increases.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/motoronin.svg" alt=motoronin> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">motoronin</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-26 19:35:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>You could even get some baffles made up for your Leos if you are really concerned about the noise. But I'd recommend putting them back on , along with the PC, and getting a custom map made at a good dyno place. Just for the benefits of loosing the weight of the stockers over the back wheel. They are seriously heavy! Do all the mods before the mapping though. Loose the SAS system along with the secondary butterflies and associated stuff. Latest thing is to also fit RC8 velocity stacks although they seem to increase top end power and torque - not midrange like you want. My bias is towards the MH airbox because Aaron, (aka Mr. MH), has spent a long time developing this for the SD - he's a true fan and deserves our support - the quality of the box is second to none.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-26 20:21:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Never mind all the questions, we are still waiting for the impressions do you do Tommy Cooper?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-27 20:39:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I can't do any great impressions, but am usually good for an attempt (with some liquid courage).</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/motoronin.svg" alt=motoronin> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">motoronin</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-27 20:46:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>You're doing a good impression of a big girl's blouse if it's too loud for you and you feel the need to put the standard bloody exhaust on.. </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/motoronin.svg" alt=motoronin> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">motoronin</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-27 20:58:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>speaking of liquid courage.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Crotchrockety.svg" alt=Crotchrockety> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Crotchrockety</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-27 21:18:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-27 21:49:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I have leo vince but with baffles, still loud but not obseane, had it mapped without any air filter, after put one in, have now just put some pods on (thanks to viking) this has increased the noise from the cans and the air pods, much noisier, wind the throttle back and even with ear plugs in, i'm scared, but bugger me the bike is very very rapid now (didn't think it was slow before) though out the rev range. no more mods needed, more than happy, just need to keep my licence <br><br>good luck with it</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bagsey.svg" alt=bagsey> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bagsey</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-28 16:02:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>"Raising the midrange torque is what I'd like to accomplish more than outright HP increases."<br><br>A mod you might consider is a two into one exhaust system. This would move the torque from top to midrange. It also saves weight. KTM LC8 Adventure, SE &amp; SM owners are modifying their exhaust collectors for single exhaust to make room for an additional rear mounted gas tank or tool box. I am hoping a SD can use one of the modified collectors from the LC8 Adventure, SE or SM bikes as they use dual exhaust, unlike the one unit boat anchor the SD uses.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Reb.svg" alt=Reb> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Reb</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-12 04:45:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/jmann.svg" alt=jmann> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">jmann</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-13 02:06:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I hear ya...I been riding 2 smoke dirt bikes , let's just say for a long, long time and my left hand all ways covers the clutch,,,waiting for the engine to sieze </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/KTM666.svg" alt=KTM666> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">KTM666</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-13 07:36:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
