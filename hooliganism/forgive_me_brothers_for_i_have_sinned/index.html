I rode a Multistrada 1200 and, eh hem, liked it. <br><br>So, its taken a few days to admit it, but yes, I took a new Multistrada for a spin and liked it. So much so, that I actually put money down on one. But, alas, two days after completing the nasty deed, I feel dirty. As if I had been proselytized. <br><br>Sunday I was bored. I wanted to it the open road, but no one else was game. So, I watched this. <a class=postlink href="http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/766/Motorcycle-Video/2010-Ducati-Multistrada-1200-First-Ride.aspx">http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/766/Motor ... -Ride.aspx</a> I tend to agree with these guy's reviews, so I was intrigued by their positive review. So, I decided to saddle up and ride to the nearest Ducati dealer to try and score a test ride. <br><br>Truth be told, the Multi wasn't bad. In fact, it was quite good. In the "urbane" mode, the fueling was spot on for putting through traffic. Once I got it off its stand (more on that later), it was quite agile - inspiring even. I didn't get a chance to take it into any real twisty bits or explore the sport mode, but in the touring mode I had no problem hitting the ton. Wind protection was also quite good at that speed - despite the fact that the screen was in its lowest position and blast was hitting me square in the shoulders. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the ride was how smooth it was when I rolled off the gas. The SD's engine braking provides a lot of engine braking. The Multi has a superb slipper and it acts more like an I4 than a V2 - its super smooth. So, it was the best of both worlds really. A boatload of torque and smoothness of an I4. <br><br>I've been looking for an all around bike for a while. I thought the Multi might be it. But, I was skeptical. Its a big bike, but it handled better than my SD in urban traffic. So, am I a convert. Will I leave the ranks of the Ducatisti and forsake the black and orange? Unlikely.<br><br>THAT FOOKING BIKE IS TOO DAMN TALL AND HEAVY. For those of you who know me, and get a chuckle when I mount the SD, the Multi is twice as bad. While trying to hoist the beast off its stand, I hyper-extended my groin. It bothered me yesterday, but hurts like hell today. While I've learned to live with the SD's height, I don't think I can deal with the Duc. Hoisting that extra 100 lbs off the stand while on tippy toes just isn't going to cut it. So, I either break my legs and have them stretched or find a shorter / narrower bike. I think I'll opt for the later.<br><br>So, my quest for the perfect bike continues. I'm looking for something to log big miles on, with wind protection, panniers, and agility to attack the twisties. Oh, and its got to be quick. In other words, unobtanium.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/tripoddave.svg" alt=tripoddave> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">tripoddave</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-09-07 05:06:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>i had the same problem getting it off the stand. that's why i stand next to the bike and cover the front brake while i push it off the stand with both feet firmly on the ground.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/KTM666.svg" alt=KTM666> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">KTM666</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-09-07 05:28:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I take it you're talking about the center stand?<br>Why would you bother putting it on that stand in normal life?<br>Just use the side stand: its seems to work quite well on the Multistrada.<br>I am a short arse and my SD is quite a bit taller than a stock machine so I get on it the same way as i get on my motocross bike and subsequently used the same technique getting on the Multistrada:<br>Stand on the LHS of the bike, grip the left handlebar grip in your Left hand,<br>push the bike away from you and kick the side stand up and return the bike to vertical,<br>push the bar forward until it is at full lock, lean the bike slightly towards you,<br>swing your right leg up and around so your calf lands on to the saddle (leg should be more or less straight - kinda like a crescent kick),<br>move towards the bike so that your thigh is on the saddle and your lower leg is hanging down the rhs of the bike.<br><br>you are now ready to set off or it is quite comfortable and stable to stand there with your left leg firmly on the ground.<br><br>BTW I have had a go on the Multistrada but only in sport mode and it is really very good indeed.

I have been putting lots of miles on my SD, a light, flickable bike, and jumping on the Duck? Well, I missed the better handling respounce of the 675 and my SD. The duck sits tall and with that height has a higher CG. It also felt less connected and almost hinge like in the corners.

So why do these damned sport touring bikes have to be so heavy??<br><br>I really am coming to the point where I'm going to make a custom seat for my SD, making the seat pan out of fiberglass and extending over the pipes, then curving around them. I can flop soft bags over that and not have them hit the pipes, and put a soft bag on top. I ride alone, so I don't have to worry about keeping 2 up capability. <br><br>If someone would build a sport tourer with a light but bit larger fairing and screen, light rear bags, 25 pounds heavier than SD, I would own it. What is it with these companies that just load the bikes up with weight?<br><br>This is something I LOVE about the SD: it's light!
