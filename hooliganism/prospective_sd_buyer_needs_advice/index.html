fun! fun! <br>- general fricking about on at the weekends and in the evenings<br>- taking the missus pillion on it for night rides around the city and along the coast (reigniting the passion!), stopping at restaurants and pubs. not for long haul touring!<br>- odd day commuting if my commuter bike breaks down.<br><br>the idea is i'm also gonna get a GSXR600 for track days and keep an old shit tip for daily commuting. i mentioned 'the need for three bikes' to her the other day but so far i don't think she's buying it. so if needs be i'll use the gixxer for commuting too. but the weekender bike will be the newer one, my 'pride and joy', so this is a really important decision for me as i want this one to be a keeper.<br><br>i haven't demo'd yet just want to get some feedback on the SD with some particular concerns i have. i'll list them below please let me know what you guys think.<br><br>- her indoors being a pillion. this ain't likely to happen too often so it's not an overriding concern, but still, its important to me. i will get her to pillion when i demo it but as a heads up, how do you guys find it 2 up? will she be OK for a couple of hours ride in the evening? will i need to replace the stock seat etc? can i get grab rails?<br>- relaiability? whenever i look on the bikes for sale websites i can never find SD with high mileage for sale? and yet if i search for e.g. speed triple theres always ones with 100K miles on there. why is that? is the SD engine etc. robust enough to cope? do you guys have high mileage ones?<br>- throttle snatchiness at low speeds. is this something i need to be aware of?<br>- differences between the year models 2005 - 2011? any particular recommendations?<br>- anything else i should inspect before i buy e.g. common part failures etc?<br>- finally i have a tuono, speed triple and a MT01 also on my list. how does the SD compare to these?<br><br>sorry if this is a loaded question and some of these things have been asked before. thanks for any advice!</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=jambox" alt=jambox> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">jambox</h3> <time datetime="2011-06-14 02:48:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-06-14 02:48:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>First of all, welcome in!<br><br> My advice?

Take care of it &amp; it'll take care of you. Peruse the forum. It is a WEALTH of info on anything and everything Superduke-related. There are plenty of folks on here with 40-50k or more trouble free miles, and some not so much....<br><br>For your intended purpose, the Gixxer would be a fine choice.<br><br>But the SD is THE choice. This bike makes me grin like an idiot each &amp; every time I ride it. And it just keeps getting better. Literally!

Trust me you need dealers when you own an ape.I love the fact that I have several dealers close. I take mine in for it's first sevice this week.With the duke you can do things to make them better.You can buy a cable that lets you plug your ecu with your laptop.I love my duke have all kinds of upgrades on or on there way.Plus the guys on this forum really know these bikes that really helps.In some cases they know more than the dealer.So you know when the dealer is giving you a load of crap.I was lucky in the states the dukes are affordable because we only have 08's ktm did not bring in any 09,10 etc.So there are some great deals out there.I wanted one in 06 just could not justify the price.I have several bikes.You will love your duke if you get one.My other bikes are collecting dust.All I want to do is ride my duke. what ever you buy good luck check their forums nothing is better than the info from the guys that ride them everyday.I have learned so much from these guys.The saved me from making rookie mistakes this is my first ktm.Go for the duke you won't be sorry grinfactor of 10</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=ShadeTheChangingMan" alt=ShadeTheChangingMan> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">ShadeTheChangingMan</h3> <time datetime="2011-06-14 11:32:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-06-14 11:32:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>they crash well </div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Petesbandit1200" alt=Petesbandit1200> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Petesbandit1200</h3> <time datetime="2011-06-14 12:10:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-06-14 12:10:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=KTM666" alt=KTM666> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">KTM666</h3> <time datetime="2011-06-14 17:51:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-06-14 17:51:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Ive done about 60000 miles on superdukes.

It's generally well engineered and refined from front to back - form really does follow function. It doesn't look like a frickin hedgehog with bits sticking out of it like an after thought. Engines are strong if looked after. Two up - not too much padding but comfortable enough. My wife is 8.5 stone &amp; 5' 8" &amp; fits well. Yours - if she doesn't know already, will need to use her legs - grip your arse with her knees to stop pushing you into the tank - this will counter no grab rail. Compared to your gixxer it's not as smooth - power pulses and all that, but that'll be the same with any twin....and low speed throttle is on/off so feathering the throttle in town isn't particularly relaxed as you do need to work at it harder than on a four.
