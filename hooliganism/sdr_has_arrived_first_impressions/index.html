Stunning looks as she is sat there on the driveway in the sun.......its the Ferngully KTM ex demo bike and I am struggling to find any signs of the 5k on the clock....mint. <br> <br>Standard cans look a bit nobby and the seat feels hard when I roll it into the garage........oh well lets get it rego'd then take it for a spin. <br> <br>So a couple of days later the big event arrives......the first ride. <br> <br>I start her up and I must admit I was underwhelmed by the muted and sad noise coming from the pipes. Where's the low bass rumble I have come to enjoy from owning Aprilia's for the last 5 years. Looks like a set of cans are on the shopping list.........I like the look of the Hexacones just need to find a dealer outside of Oz cos thery are a prooer rip-off over here. <br> <br>So I pull away fairly steadily cos all the twins I have had before have lots of low down grunt...........well f*ck me this is more like riding my Gixer. No punch from the throttle like I had with my Tuono, no front wheel hoisting grunt that used to make me smile........just a progressive and linear acceleration.........combined with a sad exhaust note. <br> <br>As I got more enthusiastic with the throttle I found myself sliding all over the rock hard seat...........its very hard to feel planted on the saddle under hard acceleration as I just slid back to the rear of the seat. If it wasn't shaped up at the back I would have ended up on the tail piece. Now I was wearing my kevlar Draggin Jeans so I hope the grip in my leathers is better otherwise I will not be able to ride this bike the way I want to. I can't even change the seat cover for something less slippy............as I cranked the bike over I found it hard to grip the tank with my inner thigh as my arse was slidding everywhere. <br> <br>So I have mixed feelings following that first ride but I can see the potential. She corners very easily and its a nice light bike to chuck around compared to the Tuono......but <br> <br>- I need a nice set of cans <br>- I need to sort out the hesitancy on the throttle <br>- I need to replace/fix the saddle or I will end up in a hedge <br> <br> <br>So please, please, please can I get some suggestions as to how to fix the seat.......I don't want a touring seat but I do need to fix the slippiness. I do plenty of trackdays so need to feel that I am in control of the seat sliding cos I do like to hang off the bike in corners.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/darko.svg" alt=darko> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">darko</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-11-27 00:38:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I think your bike is broken, because mine wheelies on power alone in the first 3 gears.

If you have a look at this forum in the "how to" popular modifications you will find a lot of helpfull advice. <br>The exhaust is a shame... same on all SD's, when that is fixed it is a different bike. I got a Mivv system on order, since I'm in NZ I face the same problem as you and I ordered it from the states. It will take probably 2 months to get it here as the seller has no stock. In the mean time I'm adapting a ZX10 Muzzy can so I can get rid of the flopping original. Besides that I changed the following things: 1-2nd gear wires, O2 plugs, 2nd butterflies and egr block of plates.. You wouldn't believe what a diferrence that makes. only 1 hour of work in it. <br>Now I love it to bits...</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Wier.svg" alt=Wier> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Wier</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-11-27 02:34:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I have a 09 SDR (which you can have look ) but I came from a standard SD prior to that. I knew what I was in for when I went to the SDR. I found that the standard SD has a bit more bottom end torque than my SDR. However the topend is crazy fast on the SDR which makes sense... Its the trackbike version. Comparing my dyno charts with a inline4 jap bike, the torque is actually fairly similar. Both reach max torque at around the same spot in the rev range. The narrower powerband of the twin just makes it feel a touch torquier IMO. <br> <br>I agree, the stock cans suck. The cat is so incredibly restrictive its not funny and it weighs a tonne. Getting rid of the stock cans will give u approx 10kg weight reduction, and will free the motor up by a huge amount. <br> <br>Check out for some pipework. Ive got a full system(from the previous SD) but the SDR has the fat headers anyway, so you can just go for a slipon. With the aussie dollar the way it is against the greenback, the prices there are sooooo much cheaper than anything in Oz. Im sure the other forum members can suggest some other sites to have a look at too. Definately have a browse on ebay. <br> <br>Throttle issues; alot of mine went away with the exhaust initially (I had the akra map loaded on) and then 80% gone with a dynotune+PCIII with 02 eliminators(the eliminators can make a big difference to snatchiness.) The tune changed the bike completely. Well worth it. There was still a bit left so I installed a G2 Throttle Cam (also on ktmtwins) and that helped heaps. Also if you are getting a surging feeling from the motor @ steady throttle around 4000rpm, its usually because the throttle bodies arent in sync but I think this is occuring less and less on the newer models. <br> <br>As far as seats go, I reluctantly bought the custom ktmtwins seat but I dont recommend it. (its not shown in the photo). Its not a good shape and makes the seating position really leant forward. If I could do it all over again, I would get a custom seat made up to suit what I was after. I know of a great seat maker near Brisbane but wouldnt have a clue regards to Sydney area, sorry. <br> <br>I know these are some expensives tidbits to improve the bike, but I honestly think they are necessary. However the best 'bang for buck' mod that you can do is swap out the crappy super restrictive airbox and throw in a MotoHooligan box, which you can find in the Parts for sale section of the forums. The horsepower gains, torque gains and power smoothing/delivery that I got from it was truly amazing. <br> <br>My bike will loft the front in 1st 2nd 3rd and get light in 4th. I love it. <br> <br>I hope this helps</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MRK01.svg" alt=MRK-01> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">MRK-01</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-11-27 03:33:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I saw that SDR in the shop for sale..!!
