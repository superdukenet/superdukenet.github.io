Thanks for putting a big o smile on my face.<br>My bad was letting my pristine 87 GSXR1100 slide off the road near Mt. St. Helens. Making my way home from the flat track race in 92 thru the woods from Mt. Ranier. Down hill with a sharp left. Had the bike leaned way over. Could not use anymore front brake cause frickin winter gloves were too thick to mash thru using the first two fingers and the rest to hang on to the loud handle. No time to un grip to use all digits. Just lean more! Right! Lost the front end. I was so close to the road with my behind no big deal with the git off. Had worst ski craches. then the thought hit me. I am still moving. Sheeeet. There goes my bike over the edges. I am spread eagle on my back trying to scrube speed off anywayposible. I grabbed the small tree branches for all I had. the bike went off the road and landed 50 feet down the ravine and totaled it's self on large rocks. I managed to stay closer to the road. Many other part of cars and bikes littered this corner. I still think the main reason I crashed was back then Mt St Helens was loaded with Motor homes with over filled shitters that leaked on this down hill bumpy ride. A shit skid of a ride on a dry day.

Put it over the kerb and through a hedge. Bust my thumb. Took a while to recuperate. Got back, on the busted bike and was determined to master, the off camber corner that had been so lairy the first time.So. Over the kerb and put it through the hole in the hedge I had created the first time.<br><br>That was 34 years ago. The hedge did not grow back.

I grabbed a handful of front anchor and did one of the first SD."Stoppies". <br>I was catapulted over the bonnet of this "Ladies"? Toyota/Vaxhaul/Ford /Whatever? I never even touched the car with my bike <br>Anyways. Police were called. (Not by me.) <br>I of course was interviewed/breathalised. <br>I had to stand in front of my Tax disc.

I had two. Backed the bike out of the garage to warm it up for a short ride. Parked the bike perpendicular in the driveway, rear tyre only a hair away from the edge of the concrete. Started the bike, walked away, and turned just in time to see it roll backwards causing the sidestand to push the bike over the opposite direction. Scratched the brake lever...lucky.<br><br>Had an HD Softail Standard that I would frequently use my friend's dad's garage to bolt on chrome accessories as we all rode and he always had beer. Got a badass Hypercharger intake that looks like a blower scoop from a muscle car with working intake butterflies and all. Installed using stock bolts, not shorter bolts that were included in kit. The longer bolt tightened prematurely, a few beers told me to keep cranking down on it, punched a perfect hole in the bowl of the carburetor. JB weld fixed it right up though.<br><br>For these reasons the mini fridge in my garage stays empty and free of beer.

Back in the day Kev got chased by the plod but left them for dead on his 350LC. Proud of this achievement he rushed indoors, threw his lid on the side and shouted, 'Mum I just burnt off the old bill on the A2'...........................<br><br>Only to find two coppers sitting in his living room! You cant outrun a radio Kev.<br><br>My own failures on motorcycles, like Klincky's, usually involved women and showing off.<br><br>1988. I had a brand new CBR1000, first brand spanking new bike I ever owned. 500 miles old I got it a Laser 4 into 2 into 1 pipe for extra 'look at me' effect..... In fact, I am starting in the middle, let's start with the day I got it.<br><br>Picked the bike up from AyeGees at Welling having p/exed my XJ600 I used to commute to work on. The balance of the purchase price came from our joint savings account that was supposed to be for our wedding Some how I have forgotten this and think my girlfriend will be impressed with the bike On the way home I notice how easily the big bike will wheely off the throttle. So I take her out for a spin..and promptly dump her off the back as she wasnt expecting it. <br><br>A day or so later I try another wheelie, away from the lights outside Woolworths in Gravesend High Street. The assorted teenage lowlife population are well impressed but the policeman that jumps out in the road outside Tesco is less so Got off with that one as claimed wasnt used to the power of this brand new bike and girlfriend on back claimed she had told me to hurry up as she was desperate for the loo. Thought I was forgiven thereafter but wasnt hence I was single when I put the Laser on the bike 500 miles later.<br>Anyway, picture the scene; Summer's day, two scantily clad little spunkers watching me as I jetwash my nearly new bike. Joe Cool me, so I tuck my gloves inside my jacket and forget to put them on when I ride the bike away from my jetwash but through the soap suds of the other jetwashes. I dont notice as I am watching these desperate bitches watching me. Give it a big handfull so the Laser can make their knickers fall down. Instead the bike goes about 200 yards sideways down the road and I go 200 ft straight up in the air. Girls laughter ringing in my ears I remeber I have no gloves on so I put one hand on the other so only one palm gets abraded to fook sliding down the road. One knee also cops it, I find out when I try to run after my bike but find my leg doesnt bend very well. I get to the bike eventually and manage to ride it home despite the bent handlebar and broken levers. My dad takes me to casualty, I have heard they charge for treatment to RTA's so I tell them I fell over jogging. The Dr looks at my wrist and ankle bones glistening in the sun light and comments I must jog pretty fast.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=StupidLuke" alt="Stupid Luke"> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Stupid Luke</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2011-11-25 22:16:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2011-11-25 22:16:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Enough preamble, so several months later and still single I start stalking this identical twin.<br><br>She was gorgeous, always will be in my memory. 18 years old and a dancer She was going out with a riding mate of mine, Paul but he was 18 too, had been with her since they were 15 and didnt realise what he had.

Then phone her when I got home to make sure she heard me Except one night when her mum and dad are reversing out of their drive as I approach at warp speed 6. I swerve around them but it is icy so my bike is soon skating straight down the road again. Whereas I bounce off a grass verge into the side of an oncoming bus, back up the verge, back into the bus, finally wind up in someone's front garden. I am pretty much unscathed, except all the coinage in my jeans pocket is either spilled all over the road or embedded in my leg..... Oh and her mum is having hysterics and whacking me around the lid (turns out she thinks I am Paul trying to end it all) apparently Paul has made a few suicide threats after getting dumped <br><br>Tried hard to get the relationship back on track after that but it was doomed (as doomed as my no claims bonus) Never did get a shag.

Some are just as daft as me.<br><br>Another personal tale. If you care? <br>It's 1990 and I have an FZR 600R. <br>On my way to work for a 12hr Doubletime shift. I am tooting down the road for this first lucrative shift and I flick the bike round a roundabout to take me under the railbridge and up the hill too hit a 1/2 mile straight. <br>As I exit the roundabout. I am confronted by a stack of cars containing many of my workmates in various modes of stupor. All on their way for the same shift.I decide to wake them up with the scream of my Micron pipe. I whack the bike open and overtake the 5 or 6 cars meandering up the hill. As I pass the last one at 3 figure speed, the crest of the hill looms. Front lifts and comes crashing down on a catseye, inducing an almighty tankslapper. I get catupulted off bike onto the verge and with the combination of "Sky/Ground/Sky/Ground. I of course try to stand up to coolly jog to a halt. Not realising I am still travelling a lot faster than any human can run. Anyways I eventualy come to a halt and pick myself up. It's at this point. I have to add that I am carrying a backpack. It is crammed full of goodies to share amongst my workmates.(WE took turns each day to bring in treats. Mine consisted of 1/2 Doz. Fudge doughnuts and 6 cartons of Ribena.) It would be fair to say that this combination. Did not survive the journey to well.<br>This was only brought home me, when the cars that I had overtaken, parked up and all the occupants got out to ask of my wellbeing. One particular driver almost fainted at the sight of "The blood and Yuck running down the back of my legs." I was oblivious as to what the fuss was. (Adrenalin rush.) <br>Anyways after all workmates had had a laugh, at what they had just witnessed and seeing I was alright, they went on their way on the daily trundle. I was left with one concerned woman. Who just so happened to have a mobile phone.(Full brick, with an ariel ).<br>It was whilst she was trudging up and down the verge. Trying to get a signal to phone her husband. (Who had a Range Rover. That would apparently accomodate me and my bike. In the back seat )<br>I decided to have a cigarette. My Fags were in my jacket pocket. I got out the pack of B+H and picked one out. I took my gloves off and reached to my back pocket of my Wranglers to get my lighter. My hand went through the top of the pocket and came out to fresh air. I felt around a bit and realised that the back righthand side of my jeans were in tatters. <br>It would appear that the intial impact of my arse to ground/road had caused my "Clipper" to ignite and blew the backside out my denims <br>If it hadn't been for the fact that I was wearing a set of leather jeans under my denims(Yeh that's how it went back then.)I am sure I would be bearing the scars still today. <br><br>Anyways as I waited fagless. My "Samaritan" Eventually reached her husband and he gave me a lift home. Where I phoned the dealers to pickup my bike. I forgot i'd left it, a 1/4 mile down the road from where I had come to rest and had ground the sidecasing down to an oil releasing big hole.<br>I still made it into work. and got my FZR fixed. But it was written off within 6 months. So forward to another. "True Life" story.

At the end of winter and nice cool Saturday with sunshine. Due to being skint as usual been prodding around below the limit as no money for petrol. Today lucky day as just been given some cash and filled the beast up to the brim. Nail it away from the petrol station and feeling like Barry Sheene flat out along a main road 90km/h.<br>Suddenly blue flashing lights and the plod behind me in a ford van. In a moment of brain clouded by teenage springtime hormones I figured out that the van’s top speed is about the same as my steed, so decide to go for the dukes of hazard escape....<br>Indicator to the left but turn right etc... Closing up to a neighbourhood which I know very well. Knowing there is a soccer field with a narrow entrance and it borders at the back to a small river with a one person narrow concrete bridge across. If I can make it over there that will made the van needing to back track for a 10 min drive to the other side. By that time I will be at home bike parked in the garage drinking cola in front of the TV...haha poor plod...<br>Full bore in to the entrance, skidding and sliding across the wet footy field to have the surprise that the poor soccer club finally found the money to close of the back of the field with a giant net on poles to prevent their balls ending up in the drink....Sh&amp;t comes to mind...<br>Do a U turn on the grass and back track to the entrance in the hope the coppers gave up or carried on to block me on the other side, no such chance as suddenly one of them jumps from behind the gate and grabs my keys, chase over. Bugger...Coppers take the yammie in the van and I get interviewed and lectured and can walk the rest of the way home and explain to the folks what happened.<br>Next day is Carnival and where I’m from it is pretty big, like second to Rio big for a small town. 6am on Sunday still in the sack but the doorbell rings WTF???? The 2 coppers are there to return my bike basically with their hands out for a carnival bonus. The old man is stubborn as hell and want nothing to do with this, the $20 I have in my pocket will hardly make things go away so we plead ignorance. Couple of days later the papers arrive with a $120 fine for speeding, refusing to stop, riding an unlicensed vehicle and so on.

Didn't take into consideration the extra weight of my buddy sitting on the back. Instead of the usual take off with spinning wheel throwing dirt, the trials tyre grabbed, the bike shot out from under us and flipped around the handlebars so that it was extended from my arms several feet in the air, upside down, front fender at my head. Buddy found himself laying on his back in the road. I had to bring it down on it's side. Was embarrassing as the gang were there to witness the fail.<br><br>You would think that that would be the last time buddy would get on the back of my bike but it wasn't. He had a few more experiences on the back, I can recall his screams as the back tyre would drop into the ditch as we drifted wide through the corners on the old dirt roads. That bike took a serious beating and was blown up three times from my abuse. The last time it blew, I rolled it into the ditch and left it there.<br><br>Two up on 70cc Yam short cutting through gravel pit to find out too late that a section of road 5 feet deep the width of a bulldozer was missing.

People inside probably laugh at me, luckily no damage to the SD. <br><br>A few weeks before that, just after I got the SD in winter '09 we had snow all over the place in the UK. It was sitting in the garage taunting me, unrideable because of the fooking snow. After nearly three weeks of waiting for a clear day, finally the roads look clear, so off we go on the inaugural commute. I froze, but I didn't care, it was one of the first rides I'd had since my previous bike got nicked and it was brilliant...until I got to the public car park just before work. All the A-roads were cleared but nobody had bothered with this car park, so there was a very thin dusting of snow. I went for a corner, started to slide, ran out of lock and down I went at about 8mph. R&amp;G took care of most of it, but I still ended up with a nice big scuff on the clutch cover (now hidden under more crash protection), and I had the privilege of finishing one of my first rides on the SD by walking it the rest of the way and parking it up.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=TLSRuss" alt=TLS_Russ> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">TLS_Russ</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2011-12-01 23:31:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2011-12-01 23:31:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Stratkat" alt=Stratkat> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Stratkat</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2011-12-02 11:01:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2011-12-02 11:01:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=sunnbmx" alt=sunnbmx> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">sunnbmx</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2011-12-03 01:52:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2011-12-03 01:52:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>OK.<br><br>After my previous post. of my FZR foray. I have to now post of the ultimate consequence.<br><br>It's 1990 I have my FZR fixed and I am at college trying for an HNC in engineering.<br><br>In my class, is a 16yr old female student.(Good Lord! What is the World coming to? Engineering/Female )<br>Anyways TMM. She is Hottt.<br>Unbeknownst to me. She likes my Body/hairstyle/motorcycle and lairy tales, that I have enthralled her with, over our meal breaks.<br>I invite her for a Blast to a track near me?<br>She says. Yeh! <br>So I pick her up and go to "The Local Track". (A place I have no interest in but is 3 miles up the road from where I live.)<br>We arrive at destination and I enthuse about "The Scene" <br>She is Sooo.. Bored.<br>She and I. Have to suggest we leave.<br><br>So we go. Just as the rain comes on and spatters the for 6 weeks dry, roads, with just a thin film of moisture.<br><br>I inform my pillion that there is a "Particular bend", we have to look out for.<br>I blast off down the road. With this nubile young Princess. Mitts clasped firmly to my waist. Doing just as instructed.<br>We encounter a few bends which the FZR shrugs off as expected. We encounter "The Harley Crowd". Which have Fecked off early . Least their chrome becomes unstable. <br> <br>Soo. We eventually come to "The Bend" (Its an uphill tightening, left hander.) I shout "This is it! Lean over".<br>My pillion does but the sound of pegs scraping and no more traction. Spells "DOOM". <br>We have a Lowside.<br>Bike hits wall and I stand up.<br><br>I get my bearings.<br>I am in the middle of a road. Dressed in bike gear. With no bike to be seen?<br>Mmmm...?<br>I enquire to myself about my wherewithall?<br><br>The" Harley Crowd". Eventually turn up.<br><br>They find my bike balancing on a wall.<br> 20 metres and 90 degrees from where I had lost it.(Balancing on a wall. Whao! That looks cool.)<br><br>Oh yes! There is my pillion, wimpering/Hanging upside down. A couple of metres up a tree. With a branch impaled through her right leg.<br><br>Them "Harley boys" arrange the Emergancy Services. (Whilst commenting on. The various tactics, I had used on circumventing their, obviously slow progress )<br> <br>And so my pillion is extracated from tree and her and I are eventualy transported to the Local Hospital.<br><br>(The Local Constabulary had also turned. And have gave me some advice. Yeh! "You could drive this Bike home. ( What!! With its fooked front wheel, two punctures. Broken forks and swingarm") <br><br>I bow to the inevitable.(And of course, to the previous ridiculous statement from The Police officer.)<br><br>Once at the Hospital. My pillion and I, are separated and are moved to individual cubicles.<br> <br>Our outer clothing is cut off.(My girl is jeanless.And so another story unfolds. Not for this Forum atmo.)<br><br>General "Chit Chat" amongst nurses ensues.<br><br>I can hear of what's going on next door.<br><br>Nurse asks pillion. :"You were lucky" . "Do you know the rider?". Answer. "Yes".<br><br>Nurse: "Is he your boyfriend/Do you love/Trust him?"<br><br>"Nubile young 17 year old pillion" answers. "Yes!"<br><br>I? (Jesus christ! I am 31! and nearly killed her.WTF!!!)<br><br><br>Upshot is..... We have now been married. For 19 years with a 12 year old son . My pillion and I. Still get on with my previous wife of two sons.<br><br>Hit me! Hit me! Hit me with your rythm stick. <br><br>And so... Ahhh yes! KTM? They only appear 8 years later in my life and are kindof like......... <br><br>....
