He sent them to the local email list and I thought I would share his experience with this forum.<br><br><br>Rick Says .... <br><br>Got a call from Deltona Jerry last night. He wants to ride both days<br>this weekend and wanted to know if he could twist my arm into doing a<br>Saturday ride to breakfast and onwards thing. Well, anyone who knows me<br>at all knows it takes very little to persuade me to go for a ride even<br>less when there is food to had! )<br><br>So I met him this morning at the Osteen Diner, one of our favorite spots<br>for breakfast. Rolled in on the Ninja and as I turned into the parking<br>lot, I spied Jerry at the far end next to a splash of ORANGE color!<br>Turns out, I find that Jerry, grinning like the Cheshire Cat, is<br>standing next to a brand new 2015 KTM 1290 Super Duke. Just knew it!<br>He could no longer hold out against scarfing up that fire sale price on<br>it he told me about a couple of weeks ago.<br><br>So, after breakfast, a fast ride is in the offering and little ol' me<br>gets to ride a 1290 Super Duke.....EGAD!!! My face must have been<br>cracking from the size of my grin when he offered to let me test ride<br>it. Yes, I was certainly tippy toed rolling it back out of the parking<br>lot space but it is way lighter than my Ninja, lighter than my SV and a<br>mere 25+ pounds more than my flyweight FZ09! Yeehawww.........monstrous<br>power to be had!<br><br>Ride evaluation and race report to follow..............as Dave<br>used to say............more to come!<br><br>Rick in Orlando <br><br>2nd email<br><br>As we slow rolled out of the diner's parking lot I noticed immediately<br>how easy and light the clutch action is. Guess the assisted slipper<br>clutch design is well thought out. The ergonomic triangle, seat-bar-peg<br>relationship was very comfy and even a short arm/leg guy like me is not<br>out of easy range, seat height notwithstanding. The wide handlebar has<br>a welcoming naked bike position, the grips feel natural and in the right<br>location. The only nit was shift pedal position was too low for<br>shifting without paying attention to the placement of my small foot.<br>That lever is very adjustable in position and Jerry decided at our first<br>rest break to reposition the lever up higher, even though his foot has a<br>longer reach than mine.<br><br>Surprisingly, with ride mode in "sport" setting, the throttle response<br>is very easy to deal with. No herky jerky on/off transitions here, just<br>smooth up/down throttle response regardless of the big or small amount<br>of grip twisting done. I am VERY impressed with the fuel management and<br>throttle response. It is very smooth and has no glitch anywhere that I<br>could try to stumble upon.<br><br>Granted, I was not pinning it, but anytime I opened it up, it just keeps<br>pulling harder in a linear fashion as the rpms rise with no sudden<br>"monster stepping out of the closet above 7K rpm" stuff. It just pulls<br>and pulls and never quits! My kind of V-twin! Its 75 degree motor has<br>non-intrusive, low frequency pulses, so like my little red Hawk, that I<br>felt right at home on this 3.5+ times more powerful motorcycle.<br><br>The suspension is firm without harshness even over really bumpy stuff.<br>No kidney bruising here, just firm compliance. The seat is firm, while<br>not a touring saddle, I would estimate a comfort range near the 100 mile<br>mark so no complaints there either.<br><br>The Brembo brakes are really easy to modulate, very powerful yet without<br>a big initial bite so getting your fingers "calibrated" takes little<br>time. The steering is nicely responsive as a naked bike should be and<br>the steering damper keeps everything well controlled without being noticed.<br><br>This bike has a fine stealth exhaust (not too quiet) rides as hard or as<br>docile as you want, sticks like stink in the corners and is smoother<br>than a non 90 degree V-twin ought to be. What's not to like?<br><br>Street Race Report next................more to come!<br><br>Rick in Orlando<br><br>Email 3<br><br>Turned off the main highway on to the wildlife reserve. Its long, very<br>straight, virtually no traffic and no side roads making it a perfect<br>place for Bogus Dave style roll-on testing!<br><br>Now the power to weight difference between Jerry on the Super Duke and<br>me on the Ninja is a bit less close than I would like but I figured it<br>was gonna be fun to see how it happened, not that I had any expectations<br>of winning a round.<br><br>We started in 2nd gear. To be honest, with much lower stock gearing,<br>the Ninja has a small advantage which was accentuated by my<br>unintentional jump starting the first run. I got a bike and a half<br>length lead, held it into third gear and then (of course) the superior<br>power of the KTM made it the victor. Still, he had to use all of the<br>upper mid-range power to make it work.<br><br>Next run in 3rd gear. We that the start-out timing correct now, "one,<br>two, three, GO!" I had a wheel out front for a few feet and his lead<br>continued to increase as we spooled up the throttles. He didn't walk<br>away hard, but he did walk away.<br><br>4th gear now. It was a complete trashing of the Kawi by the KTM. Even<br>with lower gearing, now he just begins to rocket away almost as if I was<br>still riding the Bandit 1200.<br><br>I coaxed him into another 2nd gear blast as I wanted to see it with an<br>even roll-out start. This time I got the lead again but only halfway<br>through 2nd gear. When we shift into 3rd, he easily begins to pull away<br>with a steady rate of increased separation. My bike having lower stock<br>gearing is the only reason I could be competitive on launch. 122 vs<br>150+ rear wheel horsepower makes up way more difference than the "over<br>40 pound" weight differential between the riders.<br><br>So once again, I am a game player but merely just gamey as I keep my<br>lockdown on a second place finish. As Dave would<br>say.........."That's how they ran today in central Florida."<br><br>Rick in Orlando<br><br>email 4<br><br>Sunday Ride - KTM Rules<br><br>Met KTM Jerry and Ninja Jonathan at the usual time and place for a<br>Sunday Scenic Tour. Didn't tell Jonathan about Jerry's new 1290 Super<br>Duke but as Jerry approached the light before turning in to the gas<br>station, Jon noticed right away that Jerry wasn't on an FZ09 this time.<br><br>Jerry being the kind, trusting, soul he is, (knowing Jonathan is a good<br>rider) let Jon test ride the KTM. We headed out for some of our<br>favorite twisty bits. Gotta say that it was big fun leading and chasing<br>them here or there. After about 60 miles, we stopped for a hydration<br>break and to discuss all the interesting merits of a 1290 SD.<br><br>Back on the road for more corner strafing. This time Jerry is on his<br>V-twin as I politely declined the invitation to ride it again. I don't<br>want to tempt myself as it is too expensive and too tall, so it saves me<br>from myself as I really, REALLY, do like that motorcycle. My SV may be<br>getting middle aged but it still runs great and makes me smile every<br>time I ride it.<br><br>We circled back around to the south side getting us into Tavares and a<br>Sony's BBQ lunch ahead of the "church is out" crowd. A fine feast<br>ensued followed by some more corner carving on our way back home.<br><br>Today's highlight was barreling around a long, blind sweeper, to<br>discover an old white van just crawling along. Good thing I left a bit<br>of reaction time margin so a quick squeeze on the brakes was all that's<br>needed. Being out front means YOU get the surprise, the others get<br>tipped off by your reaction.<br><br>A fine run and another 203 miles on the clock. Another great "adventure<br>in motorcycling" in my never ending quest for motorcycle satisfaction.<br><br>Hope you all have a good week and hope to see you on a ride soon!<br><br>Rick in Orlando</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Aphex.svg" alt=Aphex> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Aphex</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2016-08-23 10:56:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>It's too tall for me too, so I deal with it by not stopping often.
