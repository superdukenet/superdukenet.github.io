Is that a difficult concept to get your head round? I had a superduke and now I'm buying an RC8. Still with me? Old bike "A" is different from new bike "B" Got that? Ok...<br>So I'm doing the ring round. Along the way I ring an insurer that covered my SD three years ago....Yes hello, I was insured with you a while back blah blah<br>- Let me just get your details up. Ah yes, are you nah nah etc..<br>- New bike, RC8 la, la la...<br>- That'll be £332...<br>-Really? That's very good ok, I'll have it. .............Sorted<br><br>Next day. Documents arrive by email. Find they've reinsured the Superduke, not the RC8. Picks up phone.<br>- You've insured the wrong vehicle, either give me my money back, or give me an acceptable quote for the RC8.........Plunged into telephonic abyss as faceless insurance man does something. Eventually comes back on the line.<br>- Er, we haven't got the RC8 on our database. It's a RC8 990 superduke right.<br>- No, no,it isn't.<br>- I'll have to check with our underwriters. ...plunged into telephonic abyss for 2nd time, the seasons go by and I grow old and nearly die. Man eventually comes back on line...<br>- Yeah, can't give you a quote, the bloke who does its gone home.<br>- Oh.....Can you refund the money I paid you onto my card.<br>- No, sir its too late. I'll have to call you back in the morning.<br>- What's your name?.....gives name. Next morning I wait and wait then wait some more. Eventually I ring them up. <br>- Is Whassisname there?<br>- no, its his day off <br>- Explain entire scenario again. <br>- I'll ring you back...<br>....I'm still waiting.........................To be continued......</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AGRO.svg" alt="AGRO!"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AGRO!</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-17 13:52:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content><span style="color: #004000"></span></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/THEDUKE.svg" alt=THEDUKE> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">THEDUKE</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-17 14:44:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>LOL sorry dude but that is piss funny!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/indy84.svg" alt=indy84> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">indy84</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-17 14:51:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>the question is are you insured if you crash the RC8...its thier fault, is the new registration number of the bike on the insurance forms?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/lobster.svg" alt=lobster> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">lobster</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-17 15:09:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>If you've got the new vehicle identification number on your policy (which they must've written down in order to insure you) then I would imagine that you're insured regardless of what they decide to name the bike.

It is just one more allegory that sums up the total state of fucktness we have taken ourselves into. Noone is accountable for thier actions and proof of such is that we need for profit entities to sell us a bill of goods cause noone will take responsibity for their own actions. If the peoples acted under the old rules insurance would be laughed at. You bend it, you mend it. You break it you take it. If insurance is a big pool to limit the burden on one, to spread the burden to all in the society. The the flock do they not tie it to the registration of vehicles and make the case for a no fault clause? It is because talents could not be removed from citizens hands and be placed into greedy fat cat bastards hands if it was'nt tied to "private enterprize". Then the fuckkheads hire the least capable numbwits so as to further profit mongering, all the while leaving a lobster to crawl his way through the dead varmit system.

He amends my policy so that I'm covered on the RC8, the price is good, documents will be emailed to me that evening, Saturday at the latest. Everything is hunky-dory. I go home mollified, safe in the knowledge that a grown up is taking care of my insurance shit.<br><br>Fast forward to 5pm today. I log in to my email. No fookin' cover note, no fookin' documents, no fookin' nothin'. So that means come Monday morning I will have to ring the ass-backwards as fook insurance retards again. Bare in mind I'm supposed to be picking the motherfuckin', apeshit, impossible to insure RC8 up on Wednesday. Without a cover note, the dealer can't tax it and I can't drive it away. So this is looking less and less likely...In fact, let's be honest, it's just not going to happen is it? I've fallen into a Kafkaesque, cocksuckin', motherfuckin' fudgepackin' mire of insurance suck-ass - and at this rate, there is not a good goddam chance in hell I will be out of it by Wednesday. I have a whole world of phone calls and letters to faceless insurance 'tards in front of me before this comes good.<br>The problem here is that no one is responsible for diddlyfuckin'squat and I am not anyone's particular fookin' problem. I seriously expect this whole, clusterfuckin' tragi-farce to run and fookin' run.<br>On a separate note guys, I work as a children's entertainer and I still have some dates available...</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AGRO.svg" alt="AGRO!"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AGRO!</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-18 21:32:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I feel for ya brother.
