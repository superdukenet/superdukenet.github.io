Anyway coming home from work the other day I decide to swing by and pick up some lovely, refreshing booze. In I go, say hello to the bloke who runs it. He says hello. I take lovely, refreshing booze out of the fidge and put it in my rucksack, then take said rucksack to the counter and get my wallet out. Bloke who owns it then refuses to serve me unless I take my crash helmet off. I've...<br>a) Been going in there for 6 years.<br>b)Am clearly about to pay money for the goods.<br><br>I tell him to forget it, tip the cans of lovely refreshing booze out on the counter and storm off.

I hate jobsworths more than anything, so I'll take my money elsewhere thanks. My local Tesco Metro is somewhere i have been using for about 5 years. One night I walk in, its fooking freezing, I'm cold and just wanna get home. The women behind the counter knows who I am as I'm in there most nights. She refuses to take my money till i remove my lid. I ask the guy on the next till if he'll take my money and he says yes. The look on her face was a picture as I move my good to his till and she has to cancel the order.

New bike + no facial recognition = asking for ID.<br><br>Going on from that, I have had riders with dark visors still down or shades on come to the gate , I ask for the visor to be lifted/shades removed. As long as I can see their eyes, I can normally tell if they match their ID.<br> <br>On a second note, I too don't like taking my helmet off for fuel, and because I've normally got plugs in, I can't hear them over the tannoy so they get narked and either 1) start waving franticly or 2) come out of their little hidy hole to have a go at me, which I then reply along the lines of "Oh, sorry but I couldn't hear you. Can I have my fuel now?".<br><br>I can understand why they do it, as in incase you do a runner and they can't identify you.

It is a shame to leave booze on a counter when your taste buds had been savoring the occasion.<br>The credit card pumps in the states ask for your zip code to be punched in prior to authorization of fuel.<br>This would semi protect the possibilty of a stolen card being used.

You need to show that you are not a threat or are not conceiling an identity or else you are. <br>This is tantamount to declaring all persons are guilty until prooving thier innocence. We accept this in our societies in the guise of protecting our citizens from possible harm. Take your flipping shoes off and proof that you do not have a bomb in your feet, cause we know you do. There is a great poosibility that personal freedoms will get whittled away till the cost of doing anything will be doubled from all the "protections" we talked ourselves into needing. The only recourse is to not reward the very techniques that limit our freedoms and our innocence. Do not let the asshole check your reciept as you leave a store, do not shop there if you refuse to stand up for your innocence and send a message that behavior such as riding a motorcycle and wearing the appropriate equipment to protect your health and welfare is not tantamount to robbing a liquar store.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Superdan.svg" alt=Superdan> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Superdan</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-30 11:12:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>One of you"keep my helmet on because my airs are cold,clumsy fitting airplug,ipod using ,FTW I don't need to show my face wan$$ers may end up having a son or daughter working in a petrol/convenience store and then your precious little views will change.I just cannot believe the shit I am reading from some of you children.F???ing grow up.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-30 11:22:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I worked in a petrol station when I was 15 behind the counter, I never told bikers to take their helmet off. <br><br>I think the point is no one likes to be criminalised and been made to feel they had the potential to stick a 12 guage against the cashiers face.
