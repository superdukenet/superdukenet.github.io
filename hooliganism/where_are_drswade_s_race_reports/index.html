Well, now I will let everyone know why.<br><br>On the 28th of February I did a track day with my newly formed team, Uniform Speed. It was a cool morning and everyone was taking it easy, just laying down some smooth, easy laps.<br>I had problems with my KTM slipper and replaced it with a Yoyodyne clutch. I rolled out onto the hot pit, accelerating at my normal pace with the intention of just feeling out the clutch. Maybe 50-6- miles per hour and nearly straight upright.<br><br>Just before the exit to the pit where you turn left and enter the track, the rear of the bike shot out to the right. The feeling of this was the equivalent of someone stopping the front wheel and the rear shooting out the way it would when you grab too much throttle deep into a turn. The bike laid over on it's left side, planting <span style="font-style: italic">my</span> left side heavily onto the pavement.<br>The bike continued on, twirling and bouncing off of the barrier.<br><br>When I stopped rolling and sliding I waited a second to see if I was OK.<br>The first thing I noticed was pain in my left foot. I figured I would scoot over to the barrier and await assistance. That's when I notice my pelvis felt like a bag of loose beans or grain. Not Good! <br><br>The medics looked at me and within 30 seconds said "roll the helicopter"!<br> I spent 4 hours in a trauma room where they worked to save my life. I didn't realise how serious my condition until 10 days later when I spoke with the trauma surgeon.<br><br>I suffered a open dislocation of my left ankle with a fibular fracture. The muscles on the left side of my pelvis tore off but not before breaking the front of my pelvis. The front was separated by 4 inches and the left side was moved up by 3 inches. This strain caused the back of my pelvis to crush/shear at the sacrum. I had a torn urethrae and significant internal bleeding in my pelvis. (This was the life threatening part.) I compressed T-12. Tore my left triceps.<br><br>I had a procedure each day for the first 9 days in hospital.<br>I was released after 13 days and have been home for 3 weeks.<br>I am confined to a wheelchair for at least 2-3 months.<br>It seems I will make a full recovery with only a limp. It will be a long road though.<br><br>My racing career is over just as it started.<br>Time will tell.<br><br>I tell this story because I want to show what a great crasher the SD is. My bike will probably get totaled only because of the ridiculous replacement part prices. If the insurance company allows me to purchased the salvage rights on the bike, I will have many parts for sale in the future. I will only keep the LC8. Check out that front wheel!<br><br>I would like to note that I was wearing some very fine gear which helped keep the injuries from being greater.<br><br>I wore a Forcefield ProL2 back protector, their rib protector and adventure shorts padded underwear. My torso was bruised from my shoulders to my legs yet I suffered no rib injuries, punctured lungs or internal thoracic bleeding. I can't express how much this stuff saved me. <br>I wore Knox Handroid gloves. There was no tearing on any of the leather but at each place where there was a slider, the plastic was significantly ground down. They did their job.<br>My Alpinestars Supertech R boots are wasted. My tibia all but broke through the side of the boot. They probably saved me from further injury as the torsion devices on the inner boot is twisted and broken. they did their job.<br><br>Suit: $1000<br>Boots: $500<br>Rib protector: $100<br>Back protector: $140<br>Underwear: $150<br>Gloves: $250<br>Helmet: $800<br>All gear destroyed by crash or cut off by medics. Now useless.<br><br>Mates! Buy good gear! Protect yourselves at any cost! <br>The gear you think is costly now will seem like a bargain when you need it to perform!<br><img src="http://i858.photobucket.com/albums/ab141/drswade/P1020148.jpg" alt=Image><br><img src="http://i858.photobucket.com/albums/ab141/drswade/P1020162.jpg" alt=Image><br><img src="http://i858.photobucket.com/albums/ab141/drswade/P1020163.jpg" alt=Image><br><img src="http://i858.photobucket.com/albums/ab141/drswade/P1020168.jpg" alt=Image><br><img src="http://i858.photobucket.com/albums/ab141/drswade/P1020172.jpg" alt=Image><br><img src="http://i858.photobucket.com/albums/ab141/drswade/JR1N3201.jpg" alt=Image><br><img src="http://i858.photobucket.com/albums/ab141/drswade/JR1N3771.jpg" alt=Image><br><img src="http://i858.photobucket.com/albums/ab141/drswade/JR1N3776.jpg" alt=Image><br><img src="http://i858.photobucket.com/albums/ab141/drswade/Pelvisnoballsack.jpg" alt=Image><br><img src="http://i858.photobucket.com/albums/ab141/drswade/Crashwatchagonnado.jpg" alt=Image></div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=drswade" alt=drswade> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">drswade</h3> <time datetime="2011-04-09 22:37:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-04-09 22:37:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>I am posting a link to my photobucket below.<br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #FF0000">WARNING!!

Hell, I even thought about that front brake thing that people have experienced.<br>It was neither.<br> The experience was bizarre. Like being clotheslined, but with the rear doing a low side inspired slide out. You can see the tyre is new. Maybe 7 laps on it.<br> I have a lot of time on this model tyre and know it well. Last race in Las Vegas I was sliding both tyres in a 100mph+ right hand sweeper. Much confidence in those tyres. Very predictable.<br><br>I have since removed the clutch and sent it off to the UK to one of our SD mates.<br>The problem lies elsewhere.<br> If I had to make a wild guess it would be I hit the smallest patch of something slippery on or near a painted line.<br>This was pretty early in the day. If they run cars on the track the day before, it sometimes takes a while for the residuals to be worn off.<br>I rode this track a week after NASCAR. You have never seen a track so messy. Oil sweep EVERYWHERE! Especially on the turn ins and apexes! OUCH!<br><br>I was getting pretty fast at that track and it was a matter of time before I crashed there again. Just not like this.<br><br>If it was at a known crash spot or if it happened in a race then I would understand.<br>This just sucked!<br>Cheers everyone!<br>Rob<br>The yellow thin line is my path. The first orange dot is where I stopped and the second orange dot is where my bike ended up. The bike bounced off the last part of the right hand wall and careened over to the left.

Often seems to be the innocuous looking slip ups that do the most damage.<br><br>I just wanted to write to give you some encouragement based on experience.<br><br>My brother had a car accident some while back that resulted in very similar injuries to yours in the pelvis area and internal bleeding. He had very significant sacrum damage, lots of other broken bones including the skull as well as a lot of organ and tissue damage including lungs and liver. Overall his accident involved much more energy than yours and did more overall damage but as mentioned the pelvis, leg / abdominal injuries were similar or worse than yours.<br><br>He is walking round now with nothing more serious than weakened toe / ankle muscles, a limp and lots of numb patches around his legs. The nerves that run the leg muscles and leg senses run through the sacrum so a lot depends on how crushed and mangled that was. To be honest my brothers was a mess and over the course of about six months he still got a lot of feeling / control back. From memory he had about 4 months in a chair and a lot of time on a bike after that rebuilding leg strength.<br><br>It’s tough that you have to overcome all this and you will get down moments as it drags on but based on my experience and the description of your injuries you will almost certainly make a good recovery. Would I race after that list of breakages, probably not but then I’m getting on and a lot more chickenshit than I used to be.

I have a big external fixator so I doubt the pelvis will shift this time. Can't spend too much time surfing on this phone's tiny screen as the meds don't agree with me too much.
