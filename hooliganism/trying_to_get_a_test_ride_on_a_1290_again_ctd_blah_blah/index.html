This is the crap bike shop that is local to me and pertains to be a KTM dealer but knows nothing about them really. It sells Kawasakis Yamahas and Ducatis as well. They have consistently been a terrible place to go for as long as I've lived here but it's the nearest place and sometimes I have to go there for stuff. Last year I went in countless times to ask about the forthcoming 1290 and when they would get a demo bike in and was told a crock every time. They had my name down on numerous lists as someone interested in trying the bike with a view to purchase but never once rang me to let me know when they had stock or to follow up on all the enquiries I'd made.<br><br>But, being the sucker I am I want in again to see about booking a test ride on this bike. I know it's a Saturday but honestly I was there for fifteen minutes before I could get an idea of what I needed to do. All the spotty youths in the clothing dept. said I needed to talk to a salesman. When I asked them to point one out to me they couldn't see any except a few who were busy working through mounds of paperwork with guys buying bikes or insurance or houses or whatever. One guy who I politely asked didn't look up, just said, 'It's Saturday, there's a queue, you're at least three behind this guy".<br><br>One P&amp;H shirted man was just sitting behind a desk with his feet up reading a paper and eating a sandwich. "Hello, I wonder if you could tell me how to book a ride on that 1290 out front?" "No mate, I just do the rider training bookings, you need to talk to sales". "But I just want to find someone who can tell me when I can have a go, how long the waiting list is etc?". "Mate, come back on a week day, there's a load of free sales guys then". "But I work in the week, I want to talk to someone now. Tell you what, if I put £13,000 cash down on your desk would you give me a test ride?" "No, mate, it doesn't work like that, we're in a super busy time right now, it's a boom and bust business this is, we're in a boom today and you'll just have to wait".<br><br>Eventually after half an hour I take a punt and go to the parts counter and wait for 10 minutes more to speak to someone who looks fairly sensible. "Any chance of a test ride date for the 1290?" "I can't do it from here as our computers don't link up to the sales team's. I can tell you it's free right now but I'm not authorised to do the paperwork, you need to talk to a sales guy". "But I've been here for 45 minutes now and haven't managed to talk to one yet". "Tell you what, leave your name and number and I will get one of our dedicated sales team to ring you later to discuss a convenient time for a test ride, how about that?"<br><br>"Sounds good, thanks, I'll wait for the call".<br><br>It's now 11pm and I never got that call.<br><br>They really do not deserve to ever sell a motorbike. But more sadly I am not nearer ever getting my leg over a 1290 to compare it to my 990. <br><br>wankers.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ktmguy.svg" alt=ktmguy> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">ktmguy</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-03-22 01:09:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I really really hope some one from KTM reads this and sacks the whole lot!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/xrpilot.svg" alt=xrpilot> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">xrpilot</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-03-22 02:27:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/2014SDR.svg" alt=2014_SDR> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">2014_SDR</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-03-22 06:53:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>If you fancy a ride from West Sussex and want to test ride the 1290 give Crescents at Verwood a try they also have a Super Adventure 1290 demonstrator if you want to give that a go too, it may be 100 miles or so but there are some good roads between Crawley and Verwood.

But the weekend is never the right time to go into a dealership. Especially when you want to demo a bike. It's the day every one come in for anything and everything. Now maybe if your in some small town where it's a small dealer that doesn't keep much inventory and sales are slow due to the weather or time of year. Personally I don't know of a good dealership that is not slow. They all sit around all day doing very little. There's two way you can get a demo ride. One book it. The other is take your bike in for service. Then while you wait take one of the availible demo bikes out. <br><br>I never got a demo ride before I bought mine. And I bet 90% of us never got a one. Just buy one. You don't need the demo. The demo will be the ride home from the dealership. You won't be disappointed. It's a way better bike than the 990 was. Yes it's exspensive. But if your thinking about buying it then you can already afford it. The biggest decision will be deciding whether you want orange or black.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/2014SDR.svg" alt=2014_SDR> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">2014_SDR</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-03-22 08:59:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-03-22 09:05:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Personally I’m glad I never had a test ride on the 1290 before purchasing it (December 2013) as I might not have got one, with my daily rider bike having +170bhp the initial impressions (first couple of months) for me were not a bike I would call “The Beast” a quality bike with good power but not the a “Beast”.<br><br>It was not until I had the Cat.

I was there to spend over £10k and literally I couldn't find anyone keen to talk... I left after about 15 minutes swearing under my breath. Then I went to Redline Loughborough - those guys knows how to talk to the customer. Since then this is only dealer I talk to, friendly and helpful guys. Can test ride anything is parked outside, anytime. They kind of forced me to have a go on 1290 as I was there for something else that time.<br>I cannot understand, how you can run such a business and in the same time being so maimed with customer contacts? If you say "we will call" you MUST call, otherwise you potentially loosing a customer, who feels disregarded. It may be just employees don't give a f***, but still - I'm sure finding better ones is possible, Fortunately there are some dealers around to have a choice, but If not that's sucks, you stuck with muppets.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-03-22 11:06:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-03-22 11:06:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I used to live in London and was a loyal fan of Bracken. They introduced me to KTMs and were always brilliant and their shop was a great place to hang out. They raced supermotos and ran the Superduke cup back in the day so knew their stuff.

I hear good things about Redline and know they helped Viking out a lot during our racing adventures in Thundersport.<br><br>P&amp;H really are one of those franchises that seem to be staffed with estate agents. One of the guys I tried to talk to at the cash register said there wasn't a 1290 available yet. I said there was one outside and he said, no I was wrong, there was only a 1190 and they weren't getting any 1290s until later in the year.

Thanks for the heads up.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-03-22 15:41:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-03-22 19:01:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/CEREC1.svg" alt=CEREC1> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">CEREC1</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-03-22 19:52:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Just to get my leg over the damn machine!<br><br>I'll have to remember my fave routes from Bristol, maybe to Cheddar Gorge, down through Glastonbury and back?

I know it will be fast on a motorway but so would anything. I once swapped my Ducati SS for a friends ZZR1100 for that run through Somerset. Phew that bike was fast in a straight line.

I wrote off my first SD and the top KTM mechanic bought it off me and got it back on the road.

There used to be a service manager called "Will" who bent over backwards to help and a phone call was never a problem. Unfortunately they shit on him and he went, and it does seem to be going downhill since his demise.

Everyone used to get what was known as their "Rider Policy" and that effectively insured you for any motorcycle up to the capacity you insured against. What that effectively meant was that all of your mates could swap about bikes between themselves and be fully insured so it encouraged everyone letting each other have a go on friends bikes all the time. I don't know how I would have ever chosen a new bike to get if it wasn't for being able to try out all my mates bikes? Sunday runs were regularly a mixture of hooning about on other peoples bikes. I guess back then there was a lot more free spirit and sharing mentality. There was a sort of implicit agreement that if you binned your mates bike you would put it right. <br><br>In the modern era this habit seems to have diminished. <br><br>Me. I would let anyone ride my bike if i trusted them. First as a rider with the ability to have my bike under their control. Secondly if I thought they would do the right thing if they binned it.
