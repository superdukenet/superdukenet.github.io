It now has around 16500km's on the clock. Have used it for touring, twisties and quite a bit on the track. I would describe it as a kind of love/hate relationship between me and the Duke. When everything clicks it is the best bike in the world.<br>I ride the bike with round Acras, side panels off the airbox and the KTM Acra map with O2 sensors still in place (and yes, my conclusion is that they are still active with the Acra map). <br>Some days on some roads or tracks the bike has felt ok, other days not good at all. The throttle response is better than stock but still worse than anything else I have ridden. It works well on smooth open roads or on the track where it is ok to trail brake into the corners. On slower bumpier twisties it is horrible to ride. The stiff front end together with the touchy throttle simple doesn't inspire confidence. I can live with the jerkyness when I open the throttle. The "Hockey stick in the rear wheel" feeling when you go from small throttle openings to closed is more dangerous and difficult to handle for me. <br>I have developed techniques to ride around this. Keeping the throttle open a bit and modulate mid corner speed with the rear brake works sometime. Also the clutch needs to be covered at all times. On bumpy roads I hardly dare to scratch my nose.<br>I am sure the bike would run slightly better with a different airbox and a PCV with wideband O2 sensors etc.. I already tried to run the bike with a PCIII but in my opinion it isn't a good choice to disable the closed loop O2 feedback.<br><br>Anyway<br><br>Last night I dropped by my dealer here in Tokyo. I have been reading about how KTM now has fixed the fueling on the RC8R from 2011 with the twinspark engine. I felt that I have heard this story every year from KTM so I wanted to feel for myself if they actually improved this or not.<br>Dealer didn't have a demo bike for me to try but after a few phone calls to the KTM HQ the arranged for me to try one out later in the evening.<br>Only the white/orange version is imported to Japan and I must say it looks stunning. I never bought a bike based on how it looks but I would still enjoy having something this pretty.<br>I jumped on the bike and when for a ride. Since I was mostly interested in how the bike felt regarding throttle response and general comfort it didn't matter that I was cruising around in central Tokyo.<br>All I can say is that they finally solved the throttle issue. No issues at all to cruise around in 1st and 2nd gear. I tried to provoke it my opening and closing the throttle quickly but it still behaved flawless. Taking off from the lights reminded me of my CB1300, smooth torque that was very easy to modulate.<br>The bike also felt very fast with some incredible punch in the low to midrange revs. This is how the RC8 engine should have been from start. The SDR would be a completely different bike with this kind of throttle response. <br>For being a sportbike it also felt very comfortable. I am 191cm's tall and 100kg + but I think I could do some long days in the saddle without issues on this machine.<br><br>The only thing I am worried about is if I can adapt to the different riding position. I started my riding days as a 5year old on dirtbikes and I have always had issues with adapting the sportier bikes. I have owned a CBR1000RR, CBR600RR and an Aprilia RSV Factory but never really managed to feel connected to those bikes like I feel when riding the Duke or my 1200GS. <br>Maybe the roomier ergos on the RC8 will make a difference?<br><br>I will think about this for a couple of days before I make my decision. Would appreciate some input to the problems I have had adapting to the sportbike riding position...Maybe someone here feels the same? Maybe I can never get used to it and need to keep riding naked bikes?<br><br>I think the perfect bike would be an RC8R converted to naked without changing anything else but the handlebar and fairing (Like the RSV to Tuono conversion)<br><br><br>Sorry for the long rambling.....it just feels like a big decision </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/GoGo.svg" alt=GoGo> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">GoGo</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-22 02:55:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Lowrance.svg" alt=Lowrance> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Lowrance</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-22 03:22:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Good advice. I would wait too. I know what you mean about riding position. SD is so great that way. My view on the RC8R is completely skewed - only seat time I get on it is on the track so the riding position is great. We use wider bars on our RC8R, and I do push them farther outward for more leverage. Also gives better feel I think, more/earlier/obvious warning when the front goes away. Our RC8R is an 09. Never felt a stitch of throttle jerkiness like the SD or SDR. <br><br>Maybe you notice the wider bars in this poster we made. <br><br><img src="http://gotagteam.com/KTM_Days/images/racing_2012/2012_Open_Twins/RC8R_Poster_web.jpg" alt=Image></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Stratkat.svg" alt=Stratkat> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Stratkat</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-22 04:24:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Thanks for the advice guys.<br>One thing about all this is that I would really like to be able to get more comfortable on a proper sports bike. On the faster tracks here in Japan like Motegi and Suzuka I find that it is hard to enter fast turns with any precision with all the wind hitting my chest. I need to have a lighter grip on my bars to get any feedback but that is not possible when your holding on not the fall off from the wind blast <br><br>If I end up keeping the SDR I need to do something about the suspension. I put a harder rear spring on to reach correct sag numbers since I kept running wide out of corners. It seems like the stock valving can't cope with the higher spring rate especially at the beginning of the stroke. I think it is getting worse with time and mileage so an oil change might help the rear shock. Front end feels very stiff....more than I recall from when the bike was new.<br>I had a lowside at the track a while ago. Maybe I should check that my forks aren't slightly twisted in the triple? that for sure would cause stiction and a stiff feel to the forks.<br><br>Just don't want to spent a lot of more time and money on this bike just to end up trading it in anyway.<br><br>Not easy this...</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Lowrance.svg" alt=Lowrance> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Lowrance</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-22 04:28:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/GoGo.svg" alt=GoGo> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">GoGo</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-22 05:10:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>"I think the perfect bike would be an RC8R converted to naked without changing anything else but the handlebar and fairing (Like the RSV to Tuono conversion)"<br><br><br>My sentiments exactly....<br><br>IMHO there is no way a naked sportbike derived from the new 1290 Adventurer could be compared to a proper RC8R derived naked sportbike. No way.<br><br>Having said that, I'm sure the new SD will be adequate. It just pisses me off that we are not going to get what could potentially be the best naked on the planet (would undoubtably be if my demo ride on the RC8R is anything to go by).<br><br>Gonna get myself all spun up again if I don't stop...</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14
