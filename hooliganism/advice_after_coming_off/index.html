were really unscathed (except maybe ego-bruised - ?). When I read the thread title, I was thinking my advice would be "Get back on ASAP and ride!". Best medicine if you are able, IMO. designed</span> the SuperDuke to be crash-tolerant". This makes sense for a company from which come the world's best dirt bikes.<br><br>I'm kinda conservative, so if you haven't already (chassis - ?), I usually check: <br><br>- All hoses and lines are secure and not leaking; fuel, brakes, water, clutch, etc. Make SURE nothing is leaking.<br><br>- Inspect electrical bits: particularly the battery, major connectors, or any wiring that was exposed to the to the crash, or from the crash (e.g. lower cowl torn off/damaged). Moto fires are NOT - repeat - NOT entertaining. Unless its an H-D or Buell ... but then really just pathetically regular.<br><br>- Tyres, tyres, tyres! Can't emphasize this enough - look closely, for cuts, sidewall damage, or FOD. Nothing worse than thinking everything is "fine", then to have the carcass come apart at speed all because of an overlooked cut in the tyre. Sometimes the tyre moves on the rim (which can be confirmed if they were properly installed in the first place), or weights are lost from a crash. Balance check can be worthwhile.<br><br>- I pull the forks to ensure they are are straight, and they are not at some cockeyed/odd angle in triple clamps. <br><br>- Is the swingarm straight and true - there are moto chassis specialists that can check this<br><br>- Head bearings not loose, or binding. On that note, check all moving parts on the chassis that they are moving freely (but not more sloppy/loose than they should be).<br><br>- I check to see that what wheels and rotors are true, wheels for dings/fractures - often these can be repaired.<br><br>- I check the torques on all critical fasteners: fork, frame, subframe, swingarm, axles, calipers, etc. Seems something unexpected always comes "loose" from a shunt.<br><br>OK - not the most complete list, but without some pictures of the carnage, these are the things I generally look at first. As one should look beyond the obvious and cosmetic, if you don't trust yourself or aren't able to do these things, take it to your favorite shop and have them go over it. Explaining to them what happened (describe the crash) can be helpful for them to determine what they should look at.<br><br>Hope you're back on the road ASAP!</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=MrZ32" alt=MrZ32> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">MrZ32</h3> <time datetime="2011-09-03 23:12:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-09-03 23:12:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>I would also suggest reading twist of the wrist 2 and asses your riding as it sounds like you triggered your sr's stiffened up in the arms (can't steer then) and target fixated on where you didn't want to go (only ever look where you want to go).<br><br>Normally this is triggered by riding faster than you are confident with...

Then work out a solution to avoid it in the future... If u don't there will always be that bit of doubt in your mind, which will make you a nervous rider (not smooth and flowing), it will also ruin the rides for you (if you can't enjoy it, it will no longer be you enjoyment or escape).<br><br>example; i struggle to enjoy riding of late due to the stupid police over here... Ruins the fun and makes it a chore. But I have a plan, get the rego of the undercover cars and make anonymous complaints to the police saying that that the vehicles were acting in a dangerous and erratic manner... But play dumb and don't acknowledge that these are undercover police.. You just think they are common hoons (which they are but they have a badge and so they get away with it).<br><br>I'm of track here...
