Out of state but only 4 hours away.Price$8900. I really wanted the R even if the seat sucks.So when I went to pull the trigger the R had a deposit on it.So I bought # 2 last sat I like the bike it is like new super clean.Not even broke in yet this bike is bone stock.This morining the dealer from deal #1 calls said the deal fell thru.I can get this 08 990R brand new shipped to my door for 10,300.So now my head is spinning.I just bought #2 I have the money to buy this bike too.but I don't need 2 dukes.My question is the R that much better than the standard ? Really what is the differance I know about the shock and the seat.Do you think I should get the R and try to sell the standard duke it now has 250 miles on it but it looks like new I would sell it for 9k and it still has the warranty for 14 months The R is what I really wanted in the first place.I settled for the standard because I thought the price was right 8900 cost me 200 dollars in gas to go get it and I got a Az plate on it already.Do you think I will have a problem selling my standard 990 duke for 9k I have seen others for cheap but they had several thousand miles and no warranty.Mine is like getting a new bike.If I decide to get the R I won't put any more miles on the standard.So this bike will have 250 miles be very clean and have a warranty for 9k please any input I don't know what to do.Is thr R worth the extra? thanks for the help guys.BTW I am 55 and have raced sportbikes ,mx for 40 years I am not as fast as I used to be but I can ride.So I am not some newbe thats gonna wad up because of the power.I love wheelies and I love to ride turns anybody can go fast in a straight line.I just don't know that much about the R differance from the standard Thanks again guys Vic</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/boney95.svg" alt=boney95> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">boney95</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-17 11:17:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>The question is are you going to take it on the track?

I don't know if the performance difference justifies the extra work necessary to get the R since you already have the standard. <br><br>But, the engine differences the R has (12.2 comp ratio vice 11.5, 51mm intake valves vice 48mm, titanium valves) would be expensive to do yourself unless you locate a wrecked R donor bike or get an R warranty replacement engine as someone else here has done. I think they are both great bikes, and I was also torn on which to get. The deciding factor for me was the fact that the R was only $1k more than the standard, and I loved the idea of the engine differences more than the actual performance difference. I also love how the R tail looks. And while both are uncommon, I would be less likely to see someone with the same bike if I had the R.<br><br>However, the increased comfort, better warranty, lower price, very small difference in performance and the fact you already have the standard would motivate me to keep it. You can adjust the suspension and add a steering damper if you want it to handle like the R, and you can still haul a passenger.<br><br>Aaron</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Lowrance.svg" alt=Lowrance> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Lowrance</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-17 18:10:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hey Vic,<br>you dont do easy do ya."marksim"<br>Ive the R and no regrets and like you know i did test ride a SD first.<br>Must admit the seat is hard but im used to the firm suspension.<br>Dont forget yours is new and with a few mods you will get more power and revs in the lower gears and your still running the standard exhaust.<br>Catch ya later nice to see youve joined this forum </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/rocketchick.svg" alt=rocketchick> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">rocketchick</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-17 19:11:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Cant you chop the sd against the sdr and put it down to experience.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-17 23:50:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Thanks guys you helped me make the choice.I will keep the std.What I don't understand is why you think I could not sell it for 9k have been looking for a while.I never found a bike with such low miles and full warranty for 9k every thing I saw had 2500 miles or more and no warrranty.They sold for 9k .All the dealers that had new ones wanted 12k plus.The nada book has a used duke at 14k.So I thought $8900 out the door was a great price it was the best I have seen.You guys think I could have got it cheaper?Any way Thanks for the help.Now what should I do to get that low end lug gone.I want low end grunt I don't care about top end.I want to come out of a corner and have the power to wheelie out.On my duke the power starts at 4k.My aprilia first gear all I had to do was stab it and the front end came up.On my duke does not seem it's on the pipe unless the revs are higher.Seems like the gears are too tall.What are your thoughts on this is my duke normal? What should I do first.Can any KTM dealer remap with pipes or are there special shops.I can take it to LA to get it done or I have a dealer in Vegas.Thanks again vic</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Bert.svg" alt=Bert> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Bert</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-18 00:48:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I know you have made your choice, but I would have gotten the SDR if that is what you were always looking for, not just settle on the standard. <br>I know that when I went to a KTM demo day, about 2 months after buying my SDR, I did not like the standard as much as my R, even on the road.<br><br>As far as the engine not pulling below 4k, what sort of corner are you wanting to wheelie out of that would have your revs below 4k coming out of anyway?<br>Just don't ride in the low rpm area, even though it is a twin these things are made to rev.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/rocketchick.svg" alt=rocketchick> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">rocketchick</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-18 00:56:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>So what dealer is the SDR located at?

That's the airbox setup.. It's a great addition.. If you buy the airbox also buy the secondary butterflies. They also make sliders, I prefer theirs because the mounting bracket is black. Others brands are silver. And you may want their tank brackets also.. The Sd tank can be a pain to line up the bolt hole, so the tank brackets allow the tank to move back to make it easier to line the hole. Some people don't need the brackets and some do. It's just one of those things. <br>Hope this helps.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/preey.svg" alt=preey> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">preey</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-18 22:51:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I sold my old x battle bike 08 sd &amp; got a 2010 sdr the sdr looks nicer but thats it <br>no im just starting to get my head around the sdr but the seat kills you its not as fast as my old battle bike but its only got 900 miles on the clocks ive got all the toys to put on it just waiting for my butterflies to turn up then moto box will be going on ive also got all the kit to do the tuneecu now so my pc111 is stuck in the draw <br>think if i had a choice again i would have a sd &amp; put the sdr rear end on just for the looks</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/trackdayjunkie.svg" alt="trackday junkie"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">trackday junkie</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-18 23:26:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I've gotten around the seat issue by using a Corbin with the longest spacers and bolts provided, mounted in the front 2. Back of the seat is a bit above the stock set up at it's lowest . ( If you got bad knees and a 34" inseam this feels like heaven coming off a current crotch rocket , if you are elevationaly challenged it will be less so.)<br> Again, Track only-Yes. <br> Two or three bikes. Yep<br> Under 40 rider. 'Prolly OK<br> Old Bastard.Only bike. Not so good .(Just my opinion. )<br> Results vary. <br> IMO- Enjoy your ride.
