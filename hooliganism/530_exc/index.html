Buy your tyres from some local racers who swap out there tyres after a few races, and get some tyre irons, and change them yourself. They like to chew up rear tyres fast,but it's worth it.

I test rode it today on the street, and to be honest, I didn't find it very powerful... I was hopeing the front would come up 1-3rd gears. I know it doesn't have the power of my SD, not even close, but I was hopeing for more. Another thing, I just don't feel good about buying this perticular bike. Looking at the engine, it doesn't look like it's only got 265 miles on it? I saw rust spots on engine bolts that tells me they have been wrenched on. The guy did a half ass job on putting the graphic kit on. The right side case cover has two decent size scuff marks onto the metal from a drop on the trailer. The left side case has again decent size scuff marks (though not as bad as the right case), from his boots he says. The headlight is burnt out, or there's an electrical problem there. He's running some shit semi-syn oil that I never heard of. The rear spring is not a bright KTM Orange, but a faded orange, with two big scuff marks on it that goes through the coating of the spring, looked like the spring was coated with something? But anyways you could see metal. The kickstand doesn't fly up when you kick it up, the spring must be weak? He said something about a buddy messing it up some how. The radiator cap looks old and rusty, not what a radiator cap on on 265 mile bike should have. The chain had rust on it, with 0 lube on it.<br><br>I know it's an off road bike so it's going to have some blemishes... But I'm anal, and like things perfect. I know I'd have to replace both case covers, and do something about the botched graphic kit. I don't know??? On the other hand, I had a really good feeling from the seller. Really nice guy, family guy, had two of his young kids out in the garage with him, nice home, he offered me a beer... But my gut is telling me no. I might have to retract my offer, and keep on looking. But I heard that these EXC's are hard to come by used. And then I heard this about the 08's (my KTM dealer Tech said he has never had any problems with the EXC's):<br><br>"Keep in mind that some of the '08 first year bikes had a few problems including oil transfer, oil burning, valve stem seals, cam trouble, etc."<br><br>Thoughts, comments...?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/cdlabate.svg" alt=cdlabate> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">cdlabate</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-16 04:51:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Sounds like the price is right for what you’re getting.

The whole bike just doesn't seem right for the low number of miles/hrs on it, compared to other low mileage bikes.<br><br>I was just looking on ebay and say this 2010 EXC with 200 miles and looked at it's engine. Doesn't even compare to my EXC, it's clean as hell. Here's a link to that 2010.<br><br><a class=postlink href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/KTM-EXC-2010-530-EXC-CHAMPIONS-EDT-2010-KTM-530-EXC-CHAMPIONS-EDT-ONLY-200-MILES-6999-NR-_W0QQcmdZViewItemQQhashZitem3f0ace83aeQQitemZ270764245934QQptZUSQ5fmotorcycles">http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/KTM-EXC- ... otorcycles</a></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ShadeTheChangingMan.svg" alt=ShadeTheChangingMan> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">ShadeTheChangingMan</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-16 08:26:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I doubt those hours are correct.

A friend of mine just bought one, he is a pretty good off roader and a strong lad with little fear. He had it on maximum setting for a while, like 2 hours, that got turned to normal after it tried to kill him. Even that was too insane and it's now on the softest map setting. That is still pretty insane off road and he says when its not trying to kill him its trying to rip his arms out of their sockets. It's got uber torque and it can kick in when you really don't need it and get you in a lot of trouble. It's also a big heavy bike. <br>On the road with SM wheels it would be maximum setting all the way of course and would be a fooking great laugh. Off road I really think you would have you hands full and would get far more enjoyment out of a much smaller bike. It makes my 450 seem like a pussy cat and its anything but! Even a 450 I think is too much for a first bike. I say that from the experience of doing exactly that. With hindsight a 200 stoker or 400 would have been plenty and I'd prob be a faster rider if I'd bought one.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-17 22:59:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Sorry dude I thought I read back on the thread that you were a off road noob.
