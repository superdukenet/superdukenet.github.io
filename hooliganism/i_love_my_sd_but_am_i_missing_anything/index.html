My SD is my first ever street bike. And yes I absolutely love this bike. I've been riding street for just about a year now and I've fallen in love with it. Now I have been riding and racing off-road most of my life so I do know how to ride on two wheels...but man do I have a lot to learn when it comes to street. And I'm not young at almost 51, but I am athletic and in good shape. I can tell you all that I have absolutely fallen in love with street riding. I guess sometimes we find new passions later in life. Maybe that's a good thing as now I have more to lose so I don't do anything crazy...I try to ride safe. But the bug definitely bit me and I'm trying to gobble up every bit of information on sportbike riding that I can to gain more skills. I still suck pretty badly but I am getting a little better each time I ride. The question I have may have been asked before here but I just have to ask all of you who have the benefit of experience...am I missing anything by not trying out a Japanese sport bike? I mean I constantly see R1's and GSXR's, etc. and I always wonder if they are somehow better or more fun or easier to ride and maybe better as a first bike to learn how to corner, etc, etc.??? Don't get me wrong...the SD rocks for me but it's just one of those things I wonder about. So am I missing anything?</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=cdlabate" alt=cdlabate> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">cdlabate</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2011-05-20 03:28:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2011-05-20 03:28:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Your thoughts and experience are much like my own...ever try <span style="color: #FF8000">SUPERMOTO</span>?

Like a real motorcycle soul that you get to know and love. Before the SD I bought a Honda VFR 800i because I'd read so much about what an amazing bike it was and maybe the "best all rounder ever made". It was the most boring bike I've ever owned. It was very capably, you couldn't really fault it but everything was just boring. It wasn't super scary fast, it didn't handle like a razor, the suspension was not good really, the bike was good looking but not beautiful, and the linked brakes were truly a bad idea. I was so disappointed. It didn't have a soul. It was stolen from outside Amy's house when we first started dating and I was very happy because I used the insurance payout to pay the deposit on my current SD.<br><br>I have ridden a lot of different modern Jap sportbikes and I don't like inline fours.

There posers or at least in my area they seem to be i love seeing peoples faces at the cafe down the road when there on Mcguinness Fireblade or a Rossi R1 and they get overtaken by a "naked ktm" its priceless.<br><br>However i will say if you have the urge why not give it a go?

I initially found the transition to the SD quite a shock as the differences in feel are quite significant. Here is what I remember most from the transition.<br><br>Sports bike engines rev much higher, some people myself included, quite like the wail of a large capacity four being tortured but that’s a side issue. What it gives you is the ability to hold gears better while accelerating and cranked over, less need to change mid corner and less chance of bumping into the limiter.<br><br>By the nature of the design they are also smoother both in general and especially in the on / off throttle transition. Finally, and if I’m honest the thing I miss most, they are much faster! Crack the throttle in third on the last gixer I had and the world went into immediate fast forward as the bike exploded towards the horizon. The people who say it’s irrelevant for road riding are of course right but it is intoxicating, my bike did better than 180MPH in 5th and I visited that area more often than I should have. That’s why I changed in the end. These sports bikes are just incredibly dull to ride under 100MPH and if you have limited self control that adds up to a ticking clock with the alarm set but hidden from view.<br><br>The riding position is much less comfortable than the SD, especially over distance. It’s not as excruciating as people make out, I toured Europe on many different sports bikes without problem, but the older you get the harder it is to accommodate.<br><br>Handling is an interesting issue. At the outer limits a modern jap sports bike will probably out corner the SD but it takes a better rider than me to explore that region. What is significantly different is the feel and position. After so long on sports bikes the sit up and beg SD took some considerable adjustment and I didn’t like it much to start with. Now I have transitioned I love the handling which I think is at least as good and possible even better for the road than any of the sports bikes I have owned. In fact on the tighter twisty roads I think the SD is probably fasted and certainly more fun!<br>Brakes are great on both.<br><br>A personal view, the SD is close to perfect for the sports biased road rider. If curious you should certainly try other types of road bike, you may even switch to these for a while but it would be no great surprise if the novelty wears thin after a while and you find yourself nestling back here in SD land.<br>Have fun.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=fatbob" alt=fatbob> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">fatbob</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2011-05-20 09:54:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2011-05-20 09:54:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Wow it is amazing how many of us have similar stories.At the age of 55 I have been riding bikes most of my life.I started on dirt bikes.Husky's Cz's those were the days.I got my first street bike at 16 it was a old BSA.(wish I had it now) I rode differant brands for years.Racing MX always had a dirt bike.I have always felt being good on a dirt bike makes you a better street rider.When you know what it is like to have the rear wheel slide you don't panic.When in doubt gas it.I live by that and it has saved my life.I bought my first new street bike in 1983 a Honda 650 Night hawk. I rode that bike every day rain or shine for years.Put a kerker good tyres stripped it.did what I could to make it fast.Now sportbikes were still on the drawing boards kawi had the gpz. Then Honda came out with it VFR all hell broke loose The GSXR came out and the race was on.It was great back then everything was new.I fell in love with the 1984 fj1100 had 3 of those thru the years.Went to Keith Codes school.Then I got the FZR1000 I raced that at willow springs.Being on the track was the best.I loved to go fast and not have to worry about cars and cops.Did that for a long time.Then one day I told my wife street riding was not fun anymore.I still had my dirtbikes. So I gave up the street in 1996.I moved to Az in 98 gave up all bikes till 02 I bought a Harley 100 year heritage.I loved riding again.but something was missing.I read all the mags about the duke.I wanted one for years.I had a back surgery in 08 I could not do the sportbike thing they have become so hard to ride for any distance.I never thought I could ride anything but a crusier bike position.I got a smoking deal on a aprilia 750 DD bad ass little bike riding that told me what I was missing.I had so many jap bikes they were all the same.The ape was cool because it was so differant.Then I had to sell my DD to pay for my wife medical bills.Then it was like a gift from God I found a 08 duke with 200 miles on it.It was not a demo the guy who had it lets say did not expect the duke be such a powerful bike.He traded in for a bmw.I got it for 8900 out the door.My credit union gave a 2% $386.00 total finance charge for 4 years.I had to do it.So now I have the bike of my dreams.I love this bike It does everything I want it to do.So all I can say is you did the right thing. and so did I. It took a while but we got there.Enjoy brother every day is a good day</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4">
