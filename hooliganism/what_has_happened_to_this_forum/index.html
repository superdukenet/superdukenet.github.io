I'd previously let go a Ducati 900ss and had been hooning around London on a KTM LC4 Supermoto for a few years. The 990 seemed to be a good move back into a super bike world but with a twist. On Superduke.net there were lots of regular characters who all frequently posted up news and info and there was a HUGE community spirit on here. Colonel Klink, Shade the changing man, Millar, Jehad Joe, No.47 and many, many more. There was a golden age when we were all on this forum all the time. I guess it was between about 2007 and 2010. There were ride outs and the legendary Crash-fest races at Cadwell Park every year. <br><br>Something happened when KTM started development of the 1290. Lots of people wanted to get one and were looking forwards to the new model. Quite a few were a bit sceptical at the time. But as the new 1290 became available the forum had to include these new owners and bikes. The bikes needed little modifications to improve them because the factory had done it all. The new owners were not that bothered with modifications and upgrades - we used to joke that all they could do was fit a loud pipe and rim tape! It was definitely a different kind of owner who had a 1290 compared to the old-school 990 owners.<br><br>But gradually the 1290 became the main bike and all the discussions on here were much more about bling and ready-made aftermarket upgrades, not actually messing with the bike's engineering or performance. I went out on a few test rides on the 1290 and it was devastatingly powerful and a better bike than my 990 but I could never justify the price tag. The added performance wasn't worth it really and I (like all other 990 owners) had invested so much in upgrading and fettling and perfecting our outdated bikes that we weren't convinced to trade in our 990s for a 1290.<br><br>Gradually I visited this site less and less. Big problem was that the host doesn't really support photos and images and when Photobucket went down the tubes with subscription charges suddenly the site lost thousands of picture that supported informative posts and comments. <br><br>But the real travesty is that somehow no one is posting anything interesting anymore. <br><br>I still run my 2007 Superduke all year round, it's my main bike for long distance, commuting, track-days and if I'm ever out with a big gang of modern bikes it can still hold it's own easily. But I don't come on here very often anymore. Just checked in now and after ten days or more there is only one new post. <br><br>Just one. <br><br>It's pretty sad really.<br><br>The 1290 killed this site.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/jmann.svg" alt=jmann> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">jmann</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2020-08-25 03:39:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Comrade Bic: Yes agree with your comments entirely. I still recall with a degree of fondness all of the help I received from members to help me with my 990's.<br><br>Yes the 1290 killed off the forum because it all became about bling rather than performance or handling. I initially hoped that I'd be able to crack the encryption on the ECU and thus provide an opportunity for mods. Although I made huge progress with the CANBUS messages I never could quite crack the maps. The year of effort I put into trying to open up the ECU the got the better of me and I have subsequently stopped trying. Perhaps I've gotten too old...<br><br>Periodically I look at how dated this forum has become and think about updating the look of it but it all seems too hard in terms of the owner and moving it to an entirely new platform and domain. Dribble has offered to contribute financially towards a move but I come back to the question of is it worth it anyway?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TimR.svg" alt=TimR> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TimR</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2020-08-25 08:47:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hello Bic, glad to hear you're still riding the SD daily.<br><br>You have a strong argument about the 1290 causing the decline (not quite demise just yet), although there are other factors involved too (the photo hosting issue is a good point). Life does move on - how many of the prolific posters from the golden era still have SD's? If the forum had been kept exclusively for 990 ownership, I wonder if it would be any different now. I see 20-odd reads of this post and 1 reply (jmann - another stalwart of this site!)<br><br>I used to be a member of TL Zone (in fact I still am) when I had a TL1000S and it was good site. Before that, there was Thumperzone and TL Planet, both of which folded for reasons to do with site ownership. TLZ is still going but its nothing like it used to be. In the old days it was a great social hub and there would regularly be meet-ups and ride outs - much like SD.net. <br><br>People move on, get different bikes or get out of biking altogether. I think everything has a shelf life and when those active contributors move on, that can be the start of the decline. I blame the internet for lack of real-world contact!<br><br>I'm as guilty as most for not posting anything interesting! I've got loads of really useful help here over the last 10 years (particular thanks to people like yourself and Steve/No47) and my contribution has been fairly minimal, not least because I'm technically shit! The banter has been entertaining too. There are still people on here who contribute - I always enjoy reading Dribbleduke's posts.<br><br>My bike has been giving me endless problems over the last couple of years and between its last 2 MOT's I covered less than 200 miles. I just haven't really enjoyed riding it, but am still hoping to rekindle the love once I get the problems sorted - just too many other things getting in the way. I've just bought a new ignition coil to see if the current problem is due to a faulty coil. I promise to keep the forum updated on progress and will endeavour to post more. Perhaps we can revive SD.net!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2020-08-25 11:51:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hey, great to see your posts and familiar avatars again! It reminds me of the good old days, ha ha.<br><br>Yes, I guess that times do change and many people move on to other bikes and forums. I still keep in touch with Colonel Klink (Craig), Jamie Gardner, Shade (Duncan) and Miller (Ben) through Facebook. Meet them sometimes at The Bike Shed in Shoreditch which was founded and run by Dutch (who was an active member on here when I joined as he was riding an SDR at the time.) <br><br>I reckon I'll never sell my 990, spent far too much time and money on it over the 13 years I've owned it. It's still probably the best all round bike I've ever owned and I can't see it ever failing to deliver. I've ridden a lot of newer bikes and test ridden all the 1290s that have since been released but none of them have made me want to part with the 990. I was tempted at one time with the rs900 Kawasaki (Z900 retro-reboot) but it was honestly the most bland bike I've ever spent time on - just so absolutely soulless, very easy to ride but ultimately boring. Getting back onto my rough, loud, harsh and raucous KTM was such a pleasure. It's funny that you mention the TL forums because last year I had a mad impulse on eBay and bought a 1999 TLR for just over £2,000. What an engine! Very different to the LC8 motor - it just revs so fast and high, it's a V -Twin that thinks it's an IL4! The bike is just so of its time, big, heavy and has dubious suspension and those horrible Tokico six-pot callipers. They seised on me during the first week of ownership and I slid up the road totalling most of the original bodywork and shattering the front wheel into a concrete post. But this forced me into a total strip down and restoration and now I have a really sorted '90s superbike that looks almost like new and it's a real beauty. (Changed the brakes for later Nissins off a GSXR and they are so much better than the OE).<br><br>Anyway, I will try and get on here more often, shame the photo thing is still not really working. Pictures can really hold a forum together and are a lot more entertaining than just words.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/brudenell8146.svg" alt=brudenell8146> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">brudenell8146</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2020-08-25 14:18:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I blame social media personally.<br><br>I do spend quite a bit of time on this forum (not posting but searching previous modifications etc etc) the wealth of knowledge is amazing.<br><br>Social media has become the new place to check, mainly because people are quick to reply, but it doesn't have the same feel as any forum, sad times indeed.<br><br>The SD I have now is my 2nd and I bought the 2nd purely because I knew i fooked up when I sold my original, I won't be selling, and I will still continue to use this site.. <br><br>Maybe we should look into some meets?

My '07 990, after all these years of upgrading, is probably a better bike than a stock SDR.<br><br>On the engine front I have a full Akra titanium system combined with the Motorhooligan airbox and all the little mods like first/second gear wiring adjustments, SAS removed and Motorhooligan blank-off plates. Power commander with a custom map by HM Racing sorts out the breathing to suit. It has a dyno print out bettering the SDR for both HP and torque. I have a Suter slipper clutch, upgraded clutch slave and a HM quick-shifter.<br><br>On the cycle parts I have SDR forks and rear swing arm with a twin-pot rear brake from a KTM adventure bike. The front brakes are Brembo M4 radials with Braketec discs which are vastly superior to the OE 990 brakes. I have tried various rear shocks including the SDR but now have a Wilbers fully-adjustable race shock which is sublime. Steering is kept under control with a Scotts rotary damper (tried many different linear ones, including Ohlins, and this is way better than anything else).<br><br>All the body work was changed to SDR spec. so it's a single seat conversion and every piece of bodywork and race belly pan is carbon including the seat base which is a custom job by some German guy on this forum. <br><br>I have, in the past, tried a load of different bars, from clip-ons to high Renthal motocross type. I've got Rizoma rear-sets and minimalist Rizoma indicators and numberplate hanger. Mirrors are contemporary Kawasaki Z750 items because they have 'edge' styling and look way better than the ugly OE monstrosities. <br><br>So far, after 14 years of ownership, it's been crashed five times at race tracks (two high-sides and three low-sides) and has been repaired economically with only gravel rash being the lasting evidence. It's had so many sets of tyres I lost count completely. I've worn through three sets of front discs. It's been serviced every year by a good KTM mechanic (just valves really because I do everything else). In this time I have had to remove the factory alarm because it started malfunctioning and replace the instruments because they stopped working. I've had a recent radiator leak which I fixed myself. I've had a few horrible years with batteries dying on me and and a disastrous experiment with those light weight batteries which are shit. Apart from that I've not had any major mechanical problems and not one roadside breakdown at all. <br><br>All in all a fantastic bike and arguably the best bike I've ever owned.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/galobos.svg" alt=galobos> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">galobos</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2020-08-26 19:07:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I was looking at some of the dates when people joined this website. Twelve to thirteen years ago some the old timers and four months ago for the newly indoctrinated. Many things in our own lives have changed in the time that has passed many lives have passed since this site was founded by someone. My first foray into website shenanigans was started on this site I I had a hell of a great time maturing through the process.<br>I have learned many a lesson and read with my mouth wide open to the trials and trevails of the motor-head community never having the intestinal fortitude to pull off half the modifications this high tech membership prerequisite needs. To tell the truth I have had a slipper clutch a motohooligan airbox, SAS block off plates. Many still in boxes waiting for me to man up to the intestinal fortitude required to install this sophomoric tinker. As far as I am concerned the newness of the bike, the website membership commoradory need waning, the movement into a new chapter of my life, the loss of the original members posting about their lives and dislikes, The bike sitting twenty-four hundred miles away, Covid 19 fuckingupany resemblance of my original lifestyle. <br>I have met many great people here some as far away as Italy and as close as the town next door. with a Canadian thrown into the mix.<br>I never sign out and check this site on a daily basis. I never needed much outside this site for my web world wondering. boltr on You-tube when I need to tinker with eyes only. Be it a little naive of me, I never knew that members cared just about the bike and when it was time to move on they did. Im waiting for some members to poke their ugly thoughts and to catch up on how they are being treated outside of this site. I make up stories about a few of them and am a little surprised that inmates aren't allowed to access a computer in the facilities they are spending their time in. I mostly thinking of motor on in and that twisted jester Maddog Did Jehad find a new cause?<br>Well I am happy to see that Bic is getting better at dissing the 1290 crew in a vailed attempt at hiding his green with envy of the non luddite hooligans.<br>Carry on</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2020-08-26 19:55:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I bought my '07 SD used from Wilson's in Fresno. CA in 2012. At the time they were the oldest continually operated motorcycle dealership in the US. Well, they are gone now too .... Found this site incredibly useful in modifying and maintaining my SD. Haven't posted much because I've learned much from the forum, and haven't discovered any new revelations. I'm 73, and have been riding since I was 14. Haven't found many of the newer bikes more fun or interesting than my 990. I guess part of what I enjoy is not having the same bike as everyone else around. Had several bikes in my younger days that I now regret parting with: '72 Ducati 750GT, '73 Norton Commado, '77 Ducati 900 SS, 2002 Aprilia RST Futura. Don't think I'll part with the SD. Enjoy doing my own mods &amp; maintenance so I know it's done the way I want it! Seems most newer bikes are designed for dealer only service as much as possible, and that to me takes away part of what makes this sport special, which is what this forum was all about. Would love to meet/ride with a group of SD owners, but being from Central CAL Sierras, I don't see any 990 SD riders. See lots of bikers on CA 198, the main road to Sequoia National Park which runs through Three Rivers. However, I choose to ride some of the best back roads in the country that are around here, but I rarely see any other riders on them? <br>I share Bick's sentiments about the site being different since the introduction of the 1290, and that may partially due to changes in the rider population and their level of interest in doing their own work. I bought new an '08 BMW K1200 GT, and when I went to work on it there was almost no information regarding maintenance in the manual, nor was there easy access at time to a parts fiche online. The dealer made it plain that they were uninterested in helping me do my own maintenance, even though I was almost a 2 hour ride distant. Again, if it weren't for a forum I would have been lost.... <br>Even though there are not a lot of new postings, I don't want the forum with it's wealth of hard earned knowledge to disappear. Just a few months ago I had a weird problem with the dash, and by looking on this forum there was a specific post that addressed the issue, which was that the ground connector under the headlight, which was routed through the unused alarm connector had become loose! Without this forum and the shop manuals wiring diagrams, I never would have found it as I was looking for problems on the hot side!<br>Just the perspective of someone from across the pond....</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/brudenell8146.svg" alt=brudenell8146> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">brudenell8146</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2020-08-26 21:16:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Dribble. It is such an honour (and pleasure) to read more of your unique prose and ability to put into words what may of us immediately identify with and agree with. It's been a long time and I am glad that there are still some of us who remain on here. Both you and Jehad Joe have a writing style that was both surprising and entertaining (to an English person anyway!). <br><br>I don't consider myself an elder of this site by any means. When I joined there were many names and memories that still resonate with me. The legendary Dr. F (who had already passed away), Plipton and Twisted Jester (I still keep in touch with Jamie on Facebook - he was always soooo quick to throw in advice, support and wisdom wasn't he?). So many previous SD fanatics who had paved the way for good information and at times published and shared genuine revolutionary R&amp;D into how to improve this bike. Like Galobos, this was my first real experience with an internet 'Forum' and getting to know people through a virtual environment. I now run a design company that is totally virtual - we don't have offices or any physical assets - everyone works from where they want and when they want. 15 years ago this was science fiction and my first experiences taking and sharing stories on this forum was my first exposure to the genre. I guess in a way it has shaped the whole way that I now earn a living!<br><br>Good to see that there are still some of the old crowd still logging on here. I see loads of 1290s around the bike haunts in Surrey and nearby counties. In those days I would have always walked up to a 990 owner knowing they would be on the forum and we'd get to meet in person and cement a friendship. Got to be honest - if I see a 1290 I just don't bother anymore. I did for a few years but so often they would look at me clueless when I asked if they were on Superduke.net so I just stopped approaching them. I have three bikes at present and the '75 Kawasaki triple gets the most interest at bike meets, I'm swamped. I have a 1999 Suzuki TLR which is restored to pretty much showroom condition but with a late '70- Heron Suzuki colour scheme and this gets quite a bit of attention because it's quite rare and a period icon. But my black 990 (despite being subtly blinged up) goes unnoticed most of the time. No-one gives it a second look and few people come over to discuss it. It's like a ten year old KTM that doesn't shout (but is purely purposeful) is invisible to the majority of the contemporary biking community.<br><br>Until a pass them by at least 10mph difference on a sweeping corner ten miles down the road!

I still have my 2006 990 SD and like some will probably never let it go....well unless my son would ever want it ) Always loved this place, still do but sad to see the lights dimming here. Some blame the 1290 SD and the different owner but not me, that bike was due and needed and is a damn good bike. Who or what I blame is KTM, not for bringing the 1290 SD to market but for not keeping the 990 SD in the model line. They could have easily updated the 990 SD a LITTLE to maybe a 1025 SD but kept the basic styling, features and soul of the baddest ass hooligan bike that left room for modifications and hot rodding it like the original 990 SD. If you didn't like 990 SD and wanted to move on to the 1290 SD then you could but the way it happened you could never go back and the new to KTM rider could never experience the 990 SD either. The 1290 SD was not an entry lever hooligan bike like the 990 SD IMO. Think about how KTM did the big V-Twin Adventure model line and think about how if they would have dropped all of the other V-Twin displacements when they came out with the 1290 Super Adventure how many entry level Adventure riders they would lost? So for me the fact that KTM dropped the 1-liter V-Twin Super Duke and left us with a giant leap across to the higher priced 1290 SD IMO did in a large part of the hooligan Super Duke following and soul. Hey I'll still drop by as usual once a week to see what's going on and miss the 1-liter V-Twin hooligan old members too.<br><br>SD#1</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/nampus.svg" alt=nampus> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">nampus</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2020-08-28 09:22:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Super Duke 1<br><br>How right you are. Yes, me blaming the 1290 is too simplistic, your version is probably far closer to what happened. But also the price points. My 990 was £7,000 on '07, brand new with free Akras and a few things thrown in. This was against a background where contemporary Japanese sports bikes were all around this price with only the extra SP versions going above £10K (except Ducatis of course!).<br><br>Over the next ten years the 990 held it's price well but if you were on a budget you could definitely get into the KTM world for only £3,5K for an early '06 and £5K for a good later model SDR. Sure you could pay more but for many people this was about the acceptable price to pay for a decent bike. <br><br>But when the 1290 was released I think even the base model was over £12,000 in the UK. Twelve grand!!! That's a lot of money for a motorbike IMO. And a large percentage of it is going on electronics and rider aids that I don't want thanks very much. It also means that the type of owner and behaviour has changed a bit - they have to be cash rich or fund things with PCP loan agreements. And this, in turn alters the kind of ownership and behaviour because they're not as free (or willing) to start chopping things up and changing major components because at the end of one to three years they want to hand it back to the dealer and get a new model. <br><br>I just looked on a few sites and the 2020 1290 is £16,000!!! That's twice the price of any bike I have ever bought. (And that was a 1975 Kawasaki H2c which cost me £9K six years ago and that was a major decision that was very hard to swallow, ha ha. But it is now worth upwards of £12K so I don't regret it).</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2020-08-28 09:38:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SPEIRMOOR.svg" alt=SPEIRMOOR> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SPEIRMOOR</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2020-09-04 14:28:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I think as said by a few others before me, Facebook is a large factor in reduced popularity of bike forums in general.<br><br>I bought my 990 at the end of 2010 and sold it last year. <br>I really enjoyed coming here in the early days of my SD ownership because there was so much useful info on here. <br>People were always willing and quick with replies, but after a few years this really died down a bit. <br>And most questions that were posted were already answered in the past. <br><br>But then again, most of the questions you could ask about the sd have been asked and answered on this forum. <br><br>Last year I traded mine for a Husqvarna Vitpilen 701.
