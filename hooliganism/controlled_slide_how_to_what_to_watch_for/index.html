Problem is that I am getting to the point where the tyres are beginning slide as I push for a faster time...which usually saps my confidence and I slow my pace down. I have no experience on dirt, so I really don't know how to ride when the bike gets loose. I just want to know what I should be looking for/feeling when the bike starts to slide. A controlled slide looks pretty common when I watch racing, and wonder if I eventually have to get the point where I have to learn it to get my lap times down. I know I need more work on the set-up of the bike, but will still get to a point where it will slide. Obviously low and high side slides are what is to be avoided, and usually come quickly without warning. I have felt both tyres slide on high-g turns and usually back off the throttle a bit, but wonder if I can just keep the throttle the same, or even power out of the turn. I usually feel most slides coming out of the last third of the turn and am beginning to bring the bike up.

Not limited to body positioning however. Some sliding is fine, and some riders (e.g. professional racers) can get through corners somewhat more rapidly with some rear step out (Casey Stoner, Josh Hayes, Nick Hayden ... etc.). Most of we mere mortals cannot. I do agree that smooth is the order of the day - in all one does. And as you point out, wacking the throttle open too early on corner (exit) can result in impressive superman impersonations. Sliding for most of us on-track, should probably be avoided. There's a reason TC exists - and its not just liability prevention.<br><br>On the subject of front slides (understeer), push or whatever one wants to call it, as I like to trail brake deep (to the apex often), this description of understeer somewhat sudden on the SD is a real concern. I find it manageable under most circumstances, but have also have experienced that less-than-pleasurable event of the front suddenly washing out (not on the SD). BTW - Broken ribs suck.<br><br>On the note of effectively lengthening the trail through use of the Nichols upper triple, did you find this more or less beneficial than the adjustable shock bottom? Of course, the same result can be achieved with longer fork-caps (not commercially available that I know of - but I have a machine shop ready to address my "special projects").<br><br>I am also of the view that correct front springs for a rider's weight are of value here - not just cranking up front preload to get sag more or less correct. Correct springs also preserves factory trail (or in some cases increases it some). Of course, this also often necessitates re-valving. This is being done on my forks now.<br><br>On the the standard SD compared to the SDR: Where trail is longer to begin with; rake slightly less steep; and the shock a few mm shorter, I am questioning the benefit of the Nichols shock bottom ($400). I'd like to read your candid thoughts on this. Perhaps this is in detail elsewhere (link) ?<br><br>Any thoughts on front tyre (race tyre) profiles contributing/detracting from feel/feedback - that being a steeper "V" profile versus a rounder profile up front. The usual tradeoffs on turn-in are obvious (to me), so no need to elaborate on this. I'm thinking that a more-round profile is preferable on the SD, as turn-in is one thing that it doesn't need improvement on.<br><br>On this same note, 180/55 v. 190/55 RACE rear tyres: comments WRT to same ? I am inclined here to continue with 180/55s on the SD.<br><br>Of note - I have read all of Go-go's remarks here and in his blog. I've also spoken with the folks at Nichols, so no need to re-address that stuff either. <br><br>Again, interested in <span style="font-style: italic">your</span> opinion.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=drswade" alt=drswade> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">drswade</h3> <time datetime="2011-09-21 20:10:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-09-21 20:10:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>I agree with Jody.<br><br>If you have good throttle control and track craft you can go very fast without sliding.<br><br>That said, the SD is one of the nicest bikes to slide a little on corner exit, it has a fairly flat torque curve and fairly modest power.<br><br>I had more small, controlable "fun" slides on my first superduke than any other bike.

Well, actually I am technically, but I don't have the facts or figures about rake, trail, etc. on the SD nor the SDR.<br>Since all of the development on the triple was done for GoGo on the SDR I would have to assume that the front needed to be brought up by those 20mm.<br>When TriValley brought me on their team, the deal was that I would run the custom parts on my bike too. This wasn't to pimp the Nichols stuff. It was to assist in my success for the racing season. Although the change in geometry was so significant that I had to relearn the bike, the stability was immediately palpable. This combined with my going to the same tyres as the rest of the team's bikes: 120/60 V slick front and the 190/50 DOT rear. Michelin Power One<br>I absolutely loved the tyres and the way the bike felt once the suspension was dialed in.<br>It should also be noted that I did nothing to the suspension except swap out for a the 180 spring in the rear. I raced at 190 lbs (80 kgs+/-) and the stiffer spring was necessary to avoid sacrificing sag. With the stock spring I had to crank up the preload because I was pushing the front in sweepers. This was caused by my bike "squatting" and not forcing the front into the ground. The stiffer spring nailed it.<br><br>I started the season doing 1:59s at Infineon and ended with 1:49s and complete confidence.<br><br>I cannot comment on sliding too much as I just started doing it with both tyres during my last race weekend. I had been sliding the rear everywhere before but only due to my greedy throttle. It was always manageable with my Michelins.<br> I do remember that in a right hand sweeper that followed the back straight at Las Vegas, other guys would break and slow quite a bit whilst I would just touch the brake for steering and crank the throttle. I would describe it as "sling shotting" around those guys because of my ability to stay on the throttle. The sliding was a bit strange at first but became second nature almost immediately.<br>I wouldn't agree that sliding slows your times any more than braking through a turn slows you down.<br>It all adds up to entrance and exits.<br>I see no point of any track day rider getting this insane about riding, personally.<br>I only did it because of the incredible competition in our clubs out here.<br>In the AFM, even pro's who come here to poach very often get beaten.<br><br>Man, I miss it all just too much!</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=SDNerd" alt=SDNerd> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">SDNerd</h3> <time datetime="2011-09-21 20:22:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-09-21 20:22:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>ON another note about tyre height caused by putting on a 190.

Interesting choice of front tyre - which would have reduced trail further (!), and that taller rear tyre would reduce it further still. Combined with the SDR's shorter trail and longer shock to begin with, the shorter shock bottom makes sense. Will have to run some numbers, but I'm even more convinced that the fork bottom for my use on an SD (not SDR), isn't of great value.<br><br>Also interesting is your use of the "V" profile (which I use on my regular track bike, which benefits from it). I realise that 120/60 PowerOne (race) slicks are closer to profile of a 120/70 street tyre, than a street 120/60. But you feel the shorter sidewall was the way to go - ? I'm guessing you tried both, as well as the PowerOne DOT front - ?<br><br>I do have to run more spring than you. All there is to that. Ed Sorbo of Lindemann Engineering is installing custom springs (rate) in my SD forks as I write this. These are of stock length and diameter, requiring no modifications to install. Appropriate revalving is also being done.

The best way to exaggerate is when you get home or when you re-enter the paddock. Thell all or any who will listen, how sideways you were through turn three. <br>Fisherman do it all the time, old men do it about their conquests when they were a lad. May as well introduce into your two wheeled prowess.<br>Just joking, If you use too much hang off into a corner that it really isnt dictating that your speed needs to negotiate. The only thing you end up with is less lean angle and a good lesson asto how much getting to the inside helps. You can exaggerate as a practice all the time and you will get the benefit of getting very comfortable hanging out. The added benefit is it also lets you get rediculuis drive out of a corner and you can feel the tyre light up. There have been stories of traction controlled bikes telling writers that they were spinning it up exiting corners and they did not know they had wheel spin till the TC made them aware of it. Baby steps, you will know when enough is enough. Till then grab a handfull at the far side of the exit when you still have lean but know your on the way up and she'll spin the rear out just enough that you will be finishing the last bit pointed in a place that lets you grab even more. No exaggeration.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Dutch" alt=Dutch> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Dutch</h3> <time datetime="2011-09-22 10:54:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-09-22 10:54:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Three words: California Superbike School.

I think that for some it works to exaggerate and for others not. What really matters is getting that weight low and off however you can accomplish it. Sitting up tall in the saddle is the beginning of the end, IMO. With those huge bars it is also quite difficult to ride like you would a proper race bike.<br>If I ever ride or race again I will still probably look for a SDR to use at the track.<br>I just got so much pleasure out of guys coming by and saying "so you are on a motard?" and then flying by them on the brakes or around the inside of a turn. That was so much fun!!<br><br>@ Hotbrakes: The Japanese ride very well in the rain. That guy was putting on a clinic for rain riding!<br><br>@ Davey: On the slipper clutch: My bike was just unruly before I got one. After I got one I stopped "blipping" the throttle and that my friend, is pure laziness. I wouldn't race without one no matter how ridiculously expensive they are.<br><br>@SDNerd: I was never super comfortable at ACS. First time I was there it was 105F degrees in the garages and the track was a bit greasy. I also pussed out in turn one which will kill your flow around that track. Second time and last time I was there it was 46F degrees and scary cold with overcast. More traction issues. I did however get comfortable flying through turn one, finally. Both of my trips to that track can be seen on youtube. Even though I wasn't exactly fast there I still beat quite a few cats on their home track. The SD just sucks at tracks that need top speed. What was funny was that I would get passed on the front straight then reel them in just before the back straight. Then they would pass my like I was standing still at the end of the back straight and then they would slow me down through the other technical portions. I never nailed the turn before the back straight. I looked for my old GPS files on lap times there and can't find them. I seem to remember 1:36s as my best times although I think it was more like 1:39 in January. MAN! Was it cold!<br>One great thing about living near Infineon is that you get good there or you spend a lot of money on parts. That track is pure trial by fire! I love it!!! Top speed means shit there if you can't turn well.<br><br>I remember last year Cameron Beaubier was on the track with me. He jetted by me out of the carousel and then I almost ass packed him into T7. I then proceeded to get towed around the track for almost a whole lap. I wanted to follow him just to watch him back it in everywhere. First time I had ever seen it done to that level.<br>Now look how he rides on track days!<br><a class=postlink href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au0UHLQofPs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au0UHLQofPs</a><br><br>When I raced in the Solo 20 middleweight race in LV, I got passed by Melissa Paris, Bryce Prince, Joey Pascarella, Ryan Matter, Austin DeHaven and Tyler O'Hara on the back straight<span style="font-style: italic"> like I was stopped</span>!<br>They were battling it out and what a thrill it was to see!
