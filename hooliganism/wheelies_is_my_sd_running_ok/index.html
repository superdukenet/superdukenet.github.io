I have overtaken 2 cars then carried on up a hill and round a corner before putting the front down in a puff of smoke once. When i got my SD a couple of weeks ago I was hoping the skill would transfer over easily. Not so. Its not that it doesn't have the power to loft the front, more the fact that i'm to concerned about throwing it down the black stuff if I muff it. I've had it up for a fair way through the gears in a power wheely but have not yet the confidence to get it to the balance point. <br> <br>Also would love to master the stoppy, been practicing that also with limited success. <br> <br>Best of luck with the one wheelers Joey.

I'm 170lb. I can't imagine what would happen if I pulled the handle bars. <br> <br>It took me a while to develop the confidence to crack it wide open. I try to be relaxed in the upper body and grip the bike with my knees. I exhale when I do it to help make sure my upper body is relaxed. If I flare my elbows up or pull the bars I know I'm not relaxing. I always cover the clutch and rear brake. I always look way down the road, and not down. I'm working on running them out to the rev limiter in first and slowly building height. Not sure I will ever get to changing gears. <br> <br>It also will wheelie with much less throttle if I crack it open some to extend the forks, shut the throttle to compress the forks and then, as the forks extend, crack the throttle open a little more to bring the front up. It's all timing with this method. This is the method taught at a wheelie school I attended. The idea is that with practice you will need less and less speed/revs/throttle to get it to the balance point. Then you can get the wheel up and keep it there while moving slowly by modulating the throttle and rear brake. I'm not good so I've gone back to good old power wheelies. <br> <br>I also tried clutching it up too, but I am no good and have much less control with that method so I haven't used it much. Too much poo in my pants. <br> <br>I know lots of this is obvious, but I hope some of it helps.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=joey120373" alt=joey120373> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">joey120373</h3> <time datetime="2008-09-21 17:17:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2008-09-21 17:17:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>There are no shortcuts to wheelies..it's all about training and technique. When you find the secret key , you can wheelie with almost everything. I'm not a guru at all , i do wheelies at the highway for some km's and in smaller roads if there are no sharper curves , but i can't go as slow as i would want. The ideal speed for me on the SD is around 130-140 km/h. <br> <br>I "train" every time i'm out driving...to pop a wheelie at every speed between 0-160 km/h. I've found the technique now to lift the front wheel at 4'th gear , 150-160 km/h on a plain road....It's easy when you know it , but as always it takes a lot of training.

I am still learning the bike, and so I get very apprehensive when the front wheel does start up, I tend to do a "knee jerk" throttle down that obviously drops the front end. the point of My question was more to get a feel of how "normal" My SD was, If wheelies require "technique" and dont just come from raw power the great, Mine is running fine, but if most riders have to fight to keep the front wheel down then..... possibly mine is not as strong as some. <br> <br>Ok... all that said, The more I ride this thing the better it runs. I did an ECU relearn when I did the first oil change ( last weekend, ~630 miles ) and today I installed an HID headlight ( see other thread mixed ) and The Mar air filter. after the air filter install I did the recommended re-learn again and went for a test ride. I'll put it this way, if for nothing else than ease of service, weight reduction and sound quality the Mar air filter is worth every dime, however I have to agree with others who have installed it, it runs better too. It actually scared me! I hit it hard in first and as usual it carried the front wheel, hit second and the handle bar starts jumping all over, its pulling the front up in 2nd too! got a bit scary as I wasn't expecting it, so from whatever rpm it shifts down to in 2nd to 9800 the handlebars went crazy as the front wheel was bouncing off the pavement. It has NEVER done that before! The sound is great, may be offensive to some but I love hearing the intake, gives me a much more accurate sense of what the engine is doing that the ( for now ) stock exaust. I did get it to 130mph till traffic stopped me, I think It would have gone more If I had let it, so I think its up to par.
