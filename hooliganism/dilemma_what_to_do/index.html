All three of them have learned to ride on balance bikes and the oldest has progressed onto a first pedal bike. Christmas is looming and Amy is pushing for us getting the twins pedal bikes. All of this is great because watching your kids learn to ride is amazing and it's great time spent.<br><br>But......<br><br>I really like the idea of this new breed of electric trials bikes that are hitting the market. In the UK there is a guy who started making them for his son and now has a business doing really well. They are called OSET and run silently on batteries but are really well made and teach everything you need to know about off road riding skills and fun on two wheels. There is a 12.5 inch wheel version that is ideal for 3-6 year olds, you can even dial down the power so they they get too learn progressively. Not cheap - they retail for about £800 and really hold their value well.<br><br>On e bay they always go for between £500 and £650 for second hand. <br><br>Anyway, Amy will not accept the idea of a powered bike for our kids at this age. She deems them too dangerous. It's a load of bollox, (I think), and we have had many long debates about this but I have failed to win her over. I have watched them on ebay every week for the last six months. I know a good one and a bargain when I see one. I'm a fooking expert!<br><br>So..........<br><br>Just been following one that came to an end a few minutes ago. A beaut, one owner, spare batteries, the right model, the right colour.<br><br>I bid on it. http://osetbikes.com/us/</a><br><br>So my question is how do I break it to Amy without ending in divorce and with her giving the kids her blessings?<br><br><br></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Nukem.svg" alt=Nukem> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Nukem</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-11-05 20:33:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Awesome!

If you thought you had problems with Norbert that ain't nothing compared to what you are going to get from Amy.

If you could do this eventually you might be able to encourage her to look on ebay at a time when some scmuck has just the right thing at a ridiculously cheap price (way less than the scmuck actually paid for it) then she''ll be so pleased with how clever she has been that she might even take you out for a romantic dinner with the savings </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/cdlabate.svg" alt=cdlabate> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">cdlabate</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-11-06 02:15:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Cute kids. My oldest is not quite three, so this dilemma is on the horizon for me as well. The problem is, you have already lost the use of that great marriage doctrine, "it is better to ask forgiveness than to ask permission." <br><br>I would double-down on the safety angle. Start insisting that they wear helmets on the push bikes. Then, come in talking about how the bikes have "no brakes", and it's only a matter of time before the kids begin perching them at the top of any steep hill they can find. "If only the bike had some kind of limiter on the wheel, preventing it from going past a certain speed... like some kind of electric governor...
