Rather than turning off and taking a different route I went with the bikes when they overtook and accelerated away. After a couple of miles the one at the back got the hump with me and pulled me over. We only hit 80mph and I was a good 30 yards back but he went fooking ballistic and really wasn't happy that I couldn't wipe the grin off my face. I had such a fab ride down and just got carried away. Anyway he couldn't do me for speeding but my front tyre was at the marker on the right handside and he did me for 3 points for that.

Clocked at 117 coming out of the tunnel at Hide Park Corner on my Guzzi Daytona 1000 kitted BEARS racer. Massive, world class begging got me off and he didn't check that the chassis number wouldn't have matched the number plate I'd put on from a road - legal bike.<br><br>2. Got pulled by the Gendarmes in France for 253kp/h in a 50kp/h zone. There were men with guns and dragon's teeth across the road. Pulled our whole group, confiscated our bikes and summoned to appear before the magistrates in Alencon on the Monday (this was Saturday). Of course, when abroad we always take spare keys which you give to your mates for safe keeping so, when they went for lunch, we came back and stole our bikes back. Getting back into the UK without our passports was fun but at least we didn't ruin the trip . . . there were letters of complaint from the British Embassy waitig for us on our return, however . . . <br><br>3. When Superbike magazine was just reinventing itself they organised a double trackday (which was an almost new idea at the time) one at Oulton Park the other at Snetterton with a day's cross country thrash in between. <br>I won't bore you with the details but the main group proceeded across England with a complete disregard for other road users. At one point a lone copper stood in the middle of the road with a radar gun and waved us all into a layby. Then someone said "he can't get us all; let's go" and so we did. The police were, apparently, appealing for witnesses. (course I wasn't there)<br><br>4.

Then the Capri rolls up, yep its a copper Police Stop sign in the rear window I am fooked........ the driver jumps out of the Capri just as a cloud of steam appears from under the bonnet, guess a head gasket has popped ha,ha, the copper is really pissed and staight in my face giving me a right bollocking, 127mph + he tells me and dangerous driving and failing to stop and anything else he can think of......... I get my ticket, some more bollockings by the other coppers, threatened with arrest because I cant stop giggling at the Capri which is still steaming and the red faced driver who is still stomping around me, eventually they let me go, knowing I am looking at a ban I spend the next 2 months until the court case riding like a complete dick, I get another pull for 102mph in a 60 limit, another failing to stop, copper in a 1.3 Ford Escort chased me and I went home, pulled 1st to 3rd wheelie in front of another copper on me RD350E, nicked again......... did me for dangerous driving again and no brake light.......<br>3 court appearances later I am banned 4 times for a total of 2 years and have 21 endorsements on my licence </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Linga.svg" alt=Linga> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Linga</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-18 23:19:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I once stole a Kinder Egg when I was little...</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Viking.svg" alt=Viking> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Viking</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-19 00:02:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/jmann.svg" alt=jmann> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">jmann</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-20 03:29:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Don't know what a "Whistle Me" is.<br><br>But I do know what paranoid is, and I haven't been paranoid for years now - ever since I started taking the old Haloperidol viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=19222</a></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/fatbob.svg" alt=fatbob> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">fatbob</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-20 03:55:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Mmmm....<br><br>I don't have a video camera.(Don't think they're called that any more.)<br><br>Into KTMs and people enjoying them.<br><br> I have never spoken of bravado.(Showing off!)
