I bought my SD after my Daytona 675 got stolen. I wanted something I could do some longer rides on and the Daytona was very cramped. But it was my first big bike, my first true love and I only had it four months. A lot of the guys I ride with are sporties and I miss my baby dearly! At the end of the day it doesnt matter if you get to the end of the twisties first or last as long as your having fun doing it.<br><br>Rode a mates R1 the other day and it made me realise that sportsbikes are, for me, not a 1 bike only bike. But it also reaffirmed that I want to get a supersport again. So similar to the advice above I am going to save my little ass off and get a track bike, most likely a Daytona.<br><br>Buy the S1000r but keep the SD if you can. Maybe you ride it on the road for a while then track it, or maybe you sell it. Whatever the result its the journey that counts.

A great deal of compromise is needed to enjoy riding these machines that are not designed for public roads. For some this compromise is part of what makes them desirable. Others this makes them feel like riding a motorcycle requires too much effort and they lose interest in motorcycling all together.<br><br>I race a CBR1000, it is definitely not my favorite bike but in its element (the racetrack on a good day when I am mentally and physically prepared) yields the most breathtaking fun short of losing your virginity. The problem is making the moments where I am prepared to hop aboard this fire breathing monster and stay on top. Basically it's a handful to ride and not fun outside of ideal conditions. The SD is a much better all arounder, especially when comparing these bikes on the street. If you want to go fast, go faster. The SD doesn't give up much to a litre bike below 120mph. litre bikes aren't much fun to ride below 120mph. The power delivery of the inline 4 vs a vtwin is one of the major differences. There's a reason I've owned twice as many twins as inlines...</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Lowrance.svg" alt=Lowrance> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Lowrance</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-11-03 03:35:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Well, the last few posts kinda said what needed to be said. I've owned everything from a Honda 50 to the S1000RR and its truly in a class by itself. It really fooks up my timing. It accelerates so quickly and smoothly, its pretty easy to get in over your head. It has pretty awesome nannies to keep you upright, but they will not bail you out if you overshoot your turn in / braking points etc. <br><br>On the SD, I tended to brake late and trail into the turns. With the S1000RR,I'm arriving at my old braking points carrying anywhere from 20 to 60 mph <br><br>ABS. ABS is pretty cool. I only activated it once. I was trying to find my braking markers at the track and overshot where I wanted to start braking and grabbed a handful of front brake at about 150 mph. I felt the back lift, the brake released slightly and the back sat back down with no drama. I thought that was pretty cool. I don't usually panic, but I did this time when I grabbed a handful. I'm not sure I would have had the composure to let off the brake on my own when the rear lifted. It probably saved my bacon.<br><br>Wheelie control. When you pin the throttle, the bike will wheelie in 1st through 4th gears. (I haven't had the balls to try fifth or sixth). The front lifts very quickly and the wheelie control activates immediately. By the time I realise the bike has wheelied, the nannies have already set it down. If you keep it pinned long enough, it will pogo down the track until you upshift. I think its fun, but if you like long, sky high wheelies, this is not the bike for you - unless you turn the TC off. <br><br>Nobody really mentioned it, but you could kill two birds with one stone and get a real feel for the S1000RR if you booked a day with California Superbike School.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Linga.svg" alt=Linga> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Linga</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-11-04 12:41:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Do it and flog the hell out of it on the track.
