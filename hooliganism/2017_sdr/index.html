They had the plain black and a black and white 2017 model in the showroom. Looking at them side by side, there's no doubt in my mind that on looks alone the outgoing full orange wins hands down. <br><br>I couldn't ride the new models but I swung a leg over one. The riding position isn't vastly different. I couldn't detect the additional bar width but the whole bike felt more compact. Even at a stand-still though, I could instantly feel the suspension was tauter and the damping firmer and better balanced. There's still no preload on the forks though unless you buy the RACE cartridges.<br>The headlight I don't mind,in fact I quite like it but the rest doesn't look as sexy, as cohesive or as thought out as the outgoing model. The exo-skeleton tail-piece IMO is not as pleasing to the eye as the sculptural rear of the original with the "1290" sweeping up the underside. <br>Maybe KTM are being more conservative with styling in the hope of winning over non-KTM riders - bright orange isn't for everyone - but to me it looked like the technical upgrades (and Euro 4 costs) have been in part recouped with cosmetic cost-cutting. I really don't think it looks as good. I'll test ride the new one but unless its night and day better in all riding situations (which I doubt) I wouldn't consider parting with my glorious orange un because it makes me go YESSS! when I open the garage door. And the new one doesn't.<br><br>The new bike has a big chunky exhaust valve which has added to the extra weight and will have to be deactivated when fitting the Evo system so I wouldn't be surprised if that puts the price up (the EVO system for 2017 is unchanged). <br>On the other hand the more sophisticated electronics are going to make the performance more accessible for more people and its going to be much sharper on track, and of the extras you can in fact cherry-pick individual bits on the KTM configurator. According to the dealership you can choose this bit over that, you don't have to have the full extras package. However, as you start adding things the price rises alarmingly. They said by the time they'd added every new thing available for the 2017 model and started wading into the accessory catalogue the price was pushing £20,000...<br><br>I've no doubt the new one's going to be a fantastic bike but I was very happy to get mine back. Didn't feel I had the poor relation at all. In fact I love it even more now knowing they don't make them like that any more. <br><br>9000 mile service was £215.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Plake.svg" alt=Plake> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Plake</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2017-01-27 19:22:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Alternative option is let the new model continue to drive down the price of new leftover 2016's which are de-bugged (Rear wheels wobbling, warped shit rimmed, water in the swing-arm) bikes and go even lower than the bikes I am seeing for $13,900 brand new....</div></p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
