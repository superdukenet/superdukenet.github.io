I post this not to be judged on the wrongs and rights of my actions, merely to offer some hope to those in a similar situation.<br><br>September of 2013, I decided to go for a ride with my dad (Honda 1200 cross tourer, silky, powerful, reminded me of a sewing machine with a seat). We went up into the mountains of mid west Victoria, Australia . To a place called trentham. Rode sensibly and within all legal limits all morning . Arrived at the pub in Trentham and enjoyed a couple of refreshing ales and a nice meal. It was then time to descend back down the mountain and home to Melbourne . It is a fantastic bit of winding , country , mountain road. I decided to have a bit of a crack on the way back since dad tends to ride a bit...... Leisurely. ( one of the reasons I like riding with dad, his pace keeps me in check) . So I wind on the throttle a little more aggressively and I am having a great old time. A few clicks over the limit but well within my limits. After about 10 minutes of this I hear a horrible , horrible noise.<br><br>No not from the duke ( running like a Swiss watch @20k km) no it's a far worse noise<br>Eeee oooo eeee oooo eeee oooo, woooooooooo woo woo woo. The boys in blue. ....<br><br>Copper in an unmarked patrol car has zinged me oncoming as we both crested a rise. Probably got 2 secs warning. I had not seen him at this point , the cop did a u turn and began a pursuit.<br><br>As I am on the gas and in attack mode I and completely unaware of my new friend. He finally catches up ( took him a while he says) .<br><br>Certainly is a pretty sickening feeling getting rolled by the cops red handed. The oncoming (first detection) was 105kmh in an 80km zone. The pursuit ( second detection ) was 120kmh in an 80kmh zone.<br><br>We go through the usual rigmarole "why were you speeding ? " is the ever a good answer to that? Blah blah nothing unusual or noteworthy about the exchange. Then hands me a ticket , $470 bucks , 6 demerit points (of 12) and six months on the bus.<br><br>Well shiiiiiiite!! Being a truckie this was really an issue for me obviously. The fine and points I could wear but 6 months off the road was going to cause serious financial issues.<br><br>Initially I pretty much threw my hands in the air and walked around cursing myself, various deities and of course the cops. <br><br>Having nothing to lose and also as a stalling technique to stay on the road longer , I decided to take the matter to court. Knowing the process can take many months to finalise in court. If anything I was simply buying time. At first I thought I would represent myself and simply ask for mercy. After a bit of research I discovered this technique is by and large a waste of time. The court system ( at least in Australia) does not admire your courage or tenacity for representing yourself. You are in fact a pain in the butt who must now be painfully coached through the correct legal procedures .( this is a fact) the courts appreciate at least basic experienced representation to allow a smooth legal process( the magistrates have to get through dozens more cases) . I am only refering to the magistrates court as that is my only experience. <br><br>I decided to go for a barrister instead of a basic solicitor. His services cost me 2100 bucks for what amounted to about 3 hours work , including court time (about 7 mins in court)<br><br>Long story short, my lawyer was able to negotiate a reduced charge of 105 in an 80 zone (reduced to 103 for variance) $250 fine , 3 points and keep license. <br><br>He negotiated with the police prosecuter to stick with the first detection (laser) and delete the second detection (estimation from speedo while pursuing) from the police statement. <br><br>the whole ordeal from busted to court appearance was a bit over six months and it truly sucked. It was like the fabled sword on a string over your head. I posted this just to share my experience and perhaps offer some hope to anyone in a similar situation. As I opened with please don't judge the wrongs and rights of my actions. I am aware that what I did was perhaps foolish and I perhaps got lucky with the end result. <br><br>I now ride like my dad lol.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=wilks" alt=wilks> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">wilks</h3> <time datetime="2014-06-06 09:42:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2014-06-06 09:42:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Nice job .

I got a ticket for going 93 mph (150 kph) in a 65 mph (104 kph) zone. I chose not to fight this one, but I normally do. The fine was around $550 US, but I paid another $100 or so and opted for traffic offender school. Completing the school wipes the ticket from your driving record, i.e., no demerit points. You can take the school at least once every 18 months. (Sometimes you can take it more than once, but the judge has to give you permission to take a second offender school.) <br><br>Because you can do this, insurance companies really punish you for getting a point on your record. One time, I couldn't complete traffic school because I was in the hospital and a point showed up on my record. My insurance immediately doubled. Onc I got out of the hospital, I went to court and got permission to complete the class and wiped out the point and my rates went back down. Most offenses are 1 point and it takes 4 points in 12 months, 6 points in 24 months, or 8 points in 36 months to lose your license. (DUI's are a different matter.)<br><br>It seems though, that your system works a lot like ours. Judges know that attorneys cost money, so by hiring an attorney, you've already: (1) shown that you recognize the seriousness of your situation; (2) have taken a responsible action to address the situation; and (3) self-imposed your own fine / punishment - the cost you paid the attorney.

With this 1290 I'm now investigating radar/ laser jammers. I know for a fact that the high end jammers definitely are effective. From what I've seen so far they all look very complex and bulky. I like the idea of being able to jam a speed detection device but not at the cost of making the 1290 look like a bad science fair experiment. I passed a trooper coming the other direction while cresting a hill in a crossed up wheelie. I set it down and kept hammering down the road. Hit the next curvy road I was familiar with and never saw him again. The 1290 is like being on a date with a really crazy redhead. You know what you are doing is dangerous and will more than likely lead to heartache but something just tells you to " go ahead, it will be fun and you'll have great stories to tell". The only bike I ever had that was anywhere near as mental was the 2004 ZX10r. I can certainly see how the 1290 would be considered "un rideable " without the electronics. But , just like the redhead,I'd still like to experience the madness.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=sexparty" alt=sexparty> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">sexparty</h3> <time datetime="2014-06-07 08:10:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2014-06-07 08:10:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Nice analogy </div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=wilks" alt=wilks> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">wilks</h3> <time datetime="2014-06-07 08:15:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2014-06-07 08:15:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>The cops here are a joke.
