From online reviews I found out that the chances of recovering/getting back a stolen motorcycle is very slim<br><br>I am waiting for Insurance settlement since I had comprehensive. <br><br>I have realised that I cannot be without a bike, I am going crazy. Thus I am back in the market. I visited a local dealer and that’s when I saw this Beauty "KTM SUPERDUKE", it looks marvelous, its a little tall for me, dealer did not give me a test ride. Thus went on to do online research.<br><br>Dont ask me how I arrived at these bikes as they may not fall in the same class/category.<br>1) KTM superduke 2007 or 20008<br>2) Triumph Speedtriple 675<br>3) Ducati Monster 796<br><br>Planning to get one of the above by End of this month.<br><br>All comments and feedback welcome.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Sri.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Grendel.svg" alt=Grendel> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Grendel</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-22 04:31:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>well you're going to get a biased opinion here, it is a superduke forum after all. having said that, i'm not a fan of small revvy bikes so the triumph isn't my thing but you've just<br>come off a cbr600rr so if you liked how that rode the triumph may be a good choice for you. <br><br>the 796 ducati is probably a little underpowered, a little overpriced and a little expensive to service, premium prices and service costs are ok, if the bike is a premium bike, and<br>the 2 valve range are just not exciting enough, i suspect you might get bored with it quickly.<br><br>If you like big V-Twins the KTM is a good choice, it makes good power, is relatively fair with service costs and is a little bit different, whether you can live with a big lumpy twin<br>after the silky smooth honda in line four? ride one and see.<br><br>paul.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/good2bking.svg" alt=good2bking> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">good2bking</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-22 04:31:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Well, um....Grendel is thinking.....um about, well maybe a Superduke?!<br><br>Duh!<br><br>In fact Grendel is pretty sure the order you have them listed is the order you should buy in.

I've also owned Supermotos, the KTM 690SMC and Husky 510 (a real SM). My SD made me forget them all.<br><br>My first ride on the SD disappointed me in 2 ways, top heavy at slow speeds and lurchy. But, a return a year later when Akra slip ons had been added showed that both problems were due to pipes (stockers weigh a ton, and it's high up, and with Akras you use the Akra map) convinced me that this is the best naked package. This is the first time in over a decade that my favorite ride will be the same for the third summer in a row. Neutrality of handling, torque, great response top to bottom, comfort, there is simply nothing else that temps me. Well, loving the SD as much as I do I have been tempted to get an RC8R, but then I realise I never wish for more power from the SD, when revved out it still puts a smile on my face, I love the ergos.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SDtaxi.svg" alt=SDtaxi> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SDtaxi</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-22 18:56:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Well if your dealer wont let you demo the SD, you should be able to demo the Speed triple without a problem. Of course I love my SD, but previously owned a 2005 Speed triple, and to be honest, the engine is the best "Road" engine I have ever had the pleasure of riding. It has a more or less flat curve and you just open the throttle and it pulls like a train and does not seem to run out of puff or pull any stronger at some stupid rev range.From 2008 it got Brembo brakes and I would if I had the money have another one in the garage. The thing is,the SD is more fun per mile than the Speed triple and for me, it has to be smiles per mile. Plus side of the Triumph is it's service intervals are 6k miles where as the SD is 4.5K miles and the resale of the Triumph will be better than the SD specially If you trade in a Triumph for another Triumph.And dont buy a Ducati as the people who ride them are normally NOBS and bought the bike because of the heritage or some crap and think their shit dont smell. And monsters are for women of around 5ft tall who cant ride and will topple off at the first opportunity </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DukeofCornwall.svg" alt=DukeofCornwall> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DukeofCornwall</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-22 19:37:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I've had many a bike from race reps to choppers. The SD is the best thing out there. Mine has been on multi day touring trips covering 1000's of miles, weekend backroad blasting, and a few trackdays that it effortlessly laid the competition to waste. I was even able to do the same laptimes as my 1000RR despite the 50hp disadvantage. It's got wonderful suspension out of the box, a well balanced chassis, and a smooth motor. The quirks are negligible and I have been able to fix all myself. A little more topend is about all I could ask for but that is only a matter of pipes and a Power Commander, possibly a slight gearing change too. <br><br>As stated before, Monsters are slow and underpowered. Maintenance is much more involved as is the cost of services. Suspension is nowhere near top of the line either.<br><br>I can't speak for the Street Triple but I imagine it is as close as any non KTM can get to the SD. If it were me the deciding factor would be OTD price and proximity to the respective dealership.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Dutch.svg" alt=Dutch> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Dutch</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-22 20:53:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Thanks Gents,<br><br>hmm, I have totally rulled out Ducati Monster </div></p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
