Rob and Ady know all there is to know about race bike preparation, especially suspension and are K-Tec dealers.<br>The shock is being rebuilt by K-Tec themselves and is being re valved and shimmed at the same time<br>The forks were going to have a K-Tec kit fitted but they aren't doing a replacement system for the SD any more so we have settled for a complete rebuild and replacing the original needles with tapered ones that will actually make a difference when you move a few clicks!<br>Certainly we should notice a significant difference because the forks were in a bad state internally with one chamber completely dry and the compression needle jammed on one of the legs.<br>Suspension should be ready for pickup next Friday (24-2-12)<br><br>Pistons<br>The pistons are CP Carillo items that have been re machined finished and coated and sourced from Tornado wia Sean Wilson racing (Tornado agents in the UK) who was also the source of the high lift cams.<br>The pistons are gorgeous - engine jewelry:<br><img src="http://i1112.photobucket.com/albums/k484/dhtmbowen/IMG_0294.jpg" alt=Image><br><img src="http://i1112.photobucket.com/albums/k484/dhtmbowen/IMG_0295.jpg" alt=Image><br><br>As you can see the valve cut outs are enormous. These babies increase the compression ratio from 10:1 to 13:1.<br><br>The heads and barrels were sent to Bob Farnham for gas flowing and relining respectively.<br>The heads arrived back this week and the amount of metal removed is, IMO, quite startling.

I was told years ago by a guy who polished his ports to a mirror finish that he wished he would never had done so. He said it just sucked more gas. He thought it did not give the gas and air time or chance to mix it up. The grain of the finish marks from the sanding are at 90 degrees to the flow in these photos. That looks to me to help tumble the air / gas also to increase mixture, and looks intentional. On other hot rodded port jobs I have seen over the years, work has been done on the down wind side of the valve guides to feather air flow. Can't really see anything on the far side from these photos. Looks like a nice job to me, but I am just a shade tree gear head with open ears and eyes.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Viking.svg" alt=Viking> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Viking</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-03-02 17:44:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/tripoddave.svg" alt=tripoddave> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">tripoddave</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-03-19 15:22:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Ah.

Just poking my head back in here after a while off.<br>I am at a loss for why the plug interference wasn't noticed PRIOR to the plugs actually touching the pistons themselves.<br>I know nothing of your builder but this is something I would have noticed during the assembly and likely the oil nozzle problem too. I know we are breaking new ground here but not noticing the piston clearance is a pretty big cock up IMO. I also get nervous when I see any metal engine parts touching without assembly lube, like it looks in the cam/head photos. (My engine building expertise lies in VW engines, for the record.)<br><br>I believe that I saw a remark to find a reputable engine builder to help out. I would second that. I would be very afraid of firing up the motor on its own before it all spins nicely by hand. <br>Also, and I am sure I am not telling anyone anything new here, parts stretch at high heat/revs. What clears on the bench may not at temp/redline.<br><br>We are all awaiting a successful outcome to your brave journey!

The Germans cut and pasted a couple of bits out of my email and this is what they wrote:<br>(Their comments in <span style="color: #FF0000">RED</span>)<br><br>This is the response from Tornado this morning....<br><br><br>Upon assembly we found that the crankshaft could not be turned through 360deg because the piston skirt fouled the oil jet nozzle that cools the underside of the pistons. This problem was present at both the front and rear cylinders. We cured this problem by machining off 1mm from the nozzles.<br><span style="color: #FF0000">We heard this also form other tuners, they also machined the piston.</span><br> <br>We reassembled the motor and hand cranked again, checked that nothing fouled, reassembled and torqued the components. Hand cranked again to check and then mounted the motor in the chassis. Once the plugs were in we cranked the motor with the starter and found that the pistons foul the spark plugs (standard plugs with stock crush washers and torqued to correct setting). The pistons foul the plugs sufficiently to close the electrode gap and to break the ceramic insulator around the inner electrode.<br><span style="color: #FF0000">Should use Racing Plugs with electrode inside. Or should have to shim under.</span><br><br><span style="color: #0040FF">I would like to take this opportunity to remind our many readers that these components were bought as 'plug and play'. Tornado were asked, before any purchase was made, if there was anything I needed to be aware of, any skilled machining that needed to be done or if I could just in stall this stuff as a direct swap and run it. They were asked on more than one occasion and I was told only to make sure there was at least 1.5mm squish and that was it.</span></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-16 15:54:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>It obviously all got lost in translation </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TLSRuss.svg" alt=TLS_Russ> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TLS_Russ</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-16 20:36:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ktmguy.svg" alt=ktmguy> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">ktmguy</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-18 00:56:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>have you ever talked to Tornado folks ?

You need to remove the secondaries again. Mount the new bodies. Open the throttle 100% and check<br>if there is still a little bit of metall from the intake hose blocking the full flow after the rubber mounting. Mark it with an Edding. Stuff your intakes with cloth and seal it with some silicon or whatever you have on hand. Use your Dremel to fit the intake diameter to the new bodies.<br>Blast the metall away and you are good to go. Apart from that, the throttle bodies are plug and play.<br>Next step is to trim your current mapping down by approximatly -5% with TuneEcu. The 52mm bodies have a 14 hole spray so have a higher overall fuel throughput. With this you should be able to ride the bike, it will not be perfect, but it should run decent.<br>Finally a new Dynorun will be needed, i'm running Autotune with a Motty otherwise all these Dynoruns would have made me bankruped.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/KTM666.svg" alt=KTM666> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">KTM666</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-21 07:46:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I detect an air of dispondancy in this thread Dave, BUT look at it this way, your ring was knackered and some work needed doing anyway, you may not have more BHP so the graph shows, but as others have said take it for a spin it may rev quicker and be a different beast to ride.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/tripoddave.svg" alt=tripoddave> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">tripoddave</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-21 08:34:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>you have had it replated (bores), it is now a brand new motor... it will be feeling very tight... give her a few thousand km's and she will produce more.<br><br>that and some bigger throttle bodies</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TLSRuss.svg" alt=TLS_Russ> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TLS_Russ</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-21 09:02:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/tripoddave.svg" alt=tripoddave> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">tripoddave</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-21 13:38:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/tripoddave.svg" alt=tripoddave> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">tripoddave</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-21 14:47:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>i would not go higher than max 9800. By the way, do you do track days ? If the answer is yes, i have two more tips for you :<br>1. Have a look at the breathing back pressure valve, it sits between the cylinders under your Airbox. There is an alloy valve<br>which you can screw open. Take out the spring and metall ball. This will release crank case preassure and avoids leaks<br>at the cylinder base. You know that quite some folks struggle with that. <br>2. Change your cooling system to the SDR standard. You can buy the SDR cooling impellar and also the SDR waterpump<br>housing. This will avoid overheating as the new impellar has a way better design.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-21 18:46:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/tripoddave.svg" alt=tripoddave> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">tripoddave</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-21 19:42:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/tripoddave.svg" alt=tripoddave> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">tripoddave</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-21 20:36:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>SDR must be built 08 or newer to have 52mm diameter basically the ones with 130 ponies, all RC8 have them too ...</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/BASH69.svg" alt=BASH69> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">BASH69</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-21 22:25:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/No47.svg" alt="No. 47"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">No. 47</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-22 20:03:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I have found a set of 2008 SDR throttle bodies.<br>Internal diameter at the bottom is 51.8mm - obviously they are bigger than the standard SD ones but are they the right ones?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TLSRuss.svg" alt=TLS_Russ> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TLS_Russ</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-22 20:19:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-22 20:31:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>.......and the intake rubbers are also different on the SDR.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TLSRuss.svg" alt=TLS_Russ> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TLS_Russ</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-22 20:46:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>yes they are the right ones.

While you do this keep an eye (or ear) out for detonation. It takes time but it is worth it. After you worked a baseline out try to apply this to the rest of the ignition curve and do another run.<br><br>What I find also funny is that nobody has done a flow test on the injectors. I had a look at it and I recon that the SD ones are max 130hp, don't know about the SDR ones.<br>Someone needs to put them on a flow tester and run them at the SD fuel pressure which I believe is 43psi.<br>The SDR injectors look the same as the RC8 so they should be higher flow maybe up to 175 hp, the interesting question as asked above is how much did you had to adjust the map?<br>Keep in mind that the max recommended duty cycle for injectors is 80%.<br><br>Also did anyone had a look at the cam timing?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TLSRuss.svg" alt=TLS_Russ> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TLS_Russ</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-04 17:57:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>As promised heres my dyno printout,<br>this was done at Bob Farnhams<br><img src="http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/428830_4277572423458_1336407378_n.jpg" alt=Image></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Lowrance.svg" alt=Lowrance> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Lowrance</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-05 12:13:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Superdan.svg" alt=Superdan> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Superdan</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-05 13:36:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Can't read the dyno chart....little help please.
