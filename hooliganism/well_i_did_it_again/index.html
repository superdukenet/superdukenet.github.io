</header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>There were a few frustrating years of Superduke ownership. It seemed that the Superduke problems were only skin deep. It never left me stranded and never let me feel like it wouldn't. I love the nature of the Superduke and have not been on a motorcycle that behaved even slightly similar to it. I collected a fair amount of ancillary parts through the years. Mostly crash replacement parts and track day plastics that were always on my bike up to the day I put it up for sale. I ran knackered scratched parts for fear that if I left the new pretty parts on they would inevitably hit tarmac and ruin the pretty ones. It has been about two years since I sold the bike and I'm pretty sure no-one on this site except for Jmann was aware of my foolishness. Quite frankly I was embarrassed. Well today i purchased a 2008 White SD with 23104 on the clocks. I like the white ones and If I remember correctly they crash a little softer. This is from some pictures I saw of SDnerd's bike from many moons ago. I'm digging through it now and cleaning up the years of neglect this bike has lived with. I do not understand how a Superduke owner could have such low pride of ownership when they are-were blessed with an incredible piece of machinery. The sight tube was so stained from dare I say burnt oil that you could not discern wether it had oil in it. No it did not and upon further inspection I found it was only a half quart low.<br>There are items that I want to do to this bike that have been discussed on many occasions. That said I feel that I have earned the right not to get the "use search" bullshit thrown this way when I ask for help with certain problems. I have entertained your fat asses off and on for dam near twelve years leaving many here scratching there heads in wonder whatthefuckisheonaboutnow? I remember reading about the easy hook up for a battery tender lead from bic but don't recall what he typed. <br>Anyway here we go. <br><br>For the last two years I would say If I had a Superduke and you had a feather up your ass we would both be tickled, I'm all giggles</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=RichUK" alt=RichUK> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">RichUK</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2019-05-14 08:54:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2019-05-14 08:54:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Everyone has memories of old bikes, and through the rose coloured filter of nostalgia it is easy the want what you use to have, the pull of the past is strong..<br><br>Thing is, I have spoken to (and read) many 990 SuperDuke owners who have moved on only to regret selling their pride and joy. <br><br>Mine has had it's issues, within the first months of ownership I had to do the water pump seal, ok I was expecting that..<br>The following Spring she started loosing a bit of coolant from somewhere. I was busy with other things and had just saved enough money to upgrade my tourer so I moth balled the SD and instead focused on the selling my old &amp; buying a newer bike. Now have an 1190 Adv in the garage, and she is nice, and fast!:D <br><br>This Spring I bought new coolant hoses &amp; rad cap for the SD, clean the air filter (motohooligan), oil &amp; filter, and ACF50 treated her... even bought a compressor &amp; spray gun so I could do that properly (and because I've always wanted to own a compressor).<br><br>So this last weekend was my first proper ride on her since last August, so good to be back.

Yes, some may argue that the golden age of motorcycling ended when fuel injection became ubiquitous. While I still appreciate a set of well sorted carburetors, I contend that FI has been liberating. It's the e-nannies have become the real departure from motorcycling purity. When the machine's function is no longer entirely controlled by the rider, there is something lost - some of the craftsmanship of riding.

My mother, a voracious reader, had purchased it so it was on a shelf collecting dust when she was done with this. The motivation was the title seemed intriguing then. I'm pretty certain I scammed a "book report" (oral) out of it, recalling vaguely the perplexed (and bored) expressions of both teacher and instructor when trying to describe events and their relevance.<br><br>Thank you for the kind invitation - will look at the calendar for this.

I have also reread it a few times. I have actually purchased used copies and given them to friends that recently purchased motorcycles and have fear and anxiety over their ability to perform routine maintenance on their new toys. I can't say that any of them read the book and judging from their trepidation into servicing my guess is they did not. This particular bike was butchered by few and its my belief that the only reason it did not show more piss poor craftsmanship is the maintenance was never performed.<br>That said my last purchase was a 94 r1100gs and there was not one maintenance item performed that did not leave something else broken. Over time I found ugly at every turn of a wrench some else had performed on that bike. I still have it and it and I have bonded well. I took it to Texas for the GP round with two laners through Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, and Texas. Great trip.<br>Fill me in on Laguna track day, maybe I'll ride up and watch you crash. I did, an SV650 in turn ten. Tucked the front and slid a lllloooonnnngggg way. Dam near ended up in the paddock and then hospital. Ouch. Sold the bike after I put it back together because I was sure that it was the bike's fault. Willh may be sliding through here around the same time from his go south trip. Maybe, just maybe we can meet up.<br><br>I rode the bike in anger today a thirty six mile loop around the stomping grounds she is sweet and capable with little difference between this one and the first one minus the quietness of this. I think I like quiet. I am concerned that in order to get the fueling better I will need a richer mixture and with running the stock catalyzed exhaust tweaking the ECU will open a can of worms. I do not need more horsepower but more horses came with better fueling which came from less restricted exhaust. I wonder idk I can have my cake and eat it too.<br>Has anyone played with Tune ECU while leaving all other factory conditions the same? SAS block off plates have been installed on this bike which begs the question, Is the secondary air in place to help oxygenate the unspent fuel therefore creating an easier condition for the catalyst to stay in a heated environment creating the ability for the converter to work? hit me with the science so I can understand what is already fuckedup.<br>I need a black ergo seat the standard seat sucks.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Willh" alt=Willh> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Willh</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2019-05-22 07:32:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2019-05-22 07:32:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>I have copy of Peformance bikes that did a special on the 990SD.

Once you add another terminal to the battery that asks you to hold all that shit together and knock the terminal nut unto the floor several times before you finally back the nut up with some foam rubber all the while trying to cramb ten pounds off shit into a five pound container you realise just how important a lower center of gravity is. Do you suppose that KTM forgot about the need for a battery and then sold the idea of its placement to the marketing department to espouse the engineering marvels at KTM? Jmann its done and now I can charge my battery conveniently. These battery tenders only supply less than two ampere of pixies, I think a person could jump a thin lead off a ACC2 lead inside the headlamp assemble and fashion a USB type charging system for all motorcycles. Hell you could charge the battery from any Starbucks all across the world.<br>My replacement oil tank showed up today and to my dismay the oil drain bolt was semi-stripped as well. It had no crush washer in place and you know what that means? You just keep tightening till it quits dripping. I wonder if poor mechanical craftsmanship applies to certain makes and model bikes and gorillas prefer KTMs. Willh called from Joshua Tree this morning.

Just saying.<br>Willh and I took a short ride through my stomping grounds. Cat Canyon to Foxen Canyon to Alisos Canyon to home. It is not spectacular by any means but is representative of what California agriculture and oil extraction lands up and down the state look like. Workers in the vineyards, cows grazing oak strewn hills, pump jacks keeping a slow even beat and coastal fog taking its precious time to clear. I sent them on a rarely used road that takes them from a Freeway running North- South through Ca. 101 to the Pacific Coast Highway , Nacemiento Ferguson Road. It meanders through coastal farm range, a portion of a large army base ( Fort Hunter Liggett) and puts you high on the coast for a spectacular view. Anyway it was great entertainment and my pleasure to meet up with another member of this community. <br>I registered my bike with the ca. dmv yesterday. I had an old personalized license plate that I had on a 1983 vf750f that I used for the SD. Who knew that there are fees generated for the reinstitution of old plates. Who knew that the fee structure for registering a motor vehicle can reach a 19 line item event totaling $708.00. The plate was befitting the old Interceptor as it was in pristine condition. CHASTE, one of the definitions of chaste is "without flaw". I like the double entendre of the word in pronunciation it becomes chased which is what I will be when riding with others as I will be in front. I have the SD looking and acting chaste and am very happy with my purchase.

I said I don't need or want a different feel. He said that the forks had 122mm of air gap and that 110mm was the factory spec but he left them at 122 as that is what I had. They were not leaking and maybe just maybe the level could have changed from years of minor seepage but either way if he thought that it was an issue I believe he would have voiced concern, he did not. What does this site think?<br>I have heard of air gaps being a way to tune suspension along with viscosity changes but I am not educated on such items. We were both busy and I guess I should have asked but...<br>I am buying a summer home in Tennessee so I will locate the Superduke to that place as the roads are shit here and quite frankly It really serves little purpose here except maybe on a track.

Remember when I said or should I say typed that it would be cool to hook up a Battery Tender lead that did not have to hang out in the same place as the battery and terminals. Well I went for my new exhaust anchor maiden voyage today to check out a new job site. Pulled the bike out, got ATGATT and turned the ignition key...nothing. Pushed the bike back in feeling dejected and familiar as this has happened to me on too many to count occasions. Pulled the trusty other bike out and headed on my way after seeing my wife off in her Honda reliable car. I cursed the SD and told her I hope this bike doesn't behave like that last pieceofshit I had. She said "you should have bought a Honda" . Well upon return I diagnosed the problem while searching the inter web and then back out to the bike. The or should I say A relay was ticking away under the seat and I diagnosed my problem to be a faulty relay. Took nap returned with the bet that I should dig deeper into the ground issue. Doug deep and found a busted terminal on the ground side of battery. By terminal I mean the battery post was broke loose. Problem solved with a new LEAD ACID battery showing up in a couple of days. <br>So now, it may have been that the extra wires and terminals that were put in place to install the Battery Tender lead caused undo stress on all the goings on down there. That said I am bound and determined to fashion a lead that uses the SAE terminal connector that joyfully plugs my battery tender in connected to spade connectors that plug into the ACC2 terminals. I'll dangle the lead out just far enough out the headlamp assembly for easy access and this will allow pixies to flow into the battery during non use periods. I think.<br>It was a bit strange to see lithium iron batteries down to the same price range as the more expensive( but probably no better) lead acid batteries. I want to just hop on my bike and ride like I use to do when I rode Hondas. You know how many bikes I have brought back from the grave, remnants leaning on the outside of a garage wall with a ripped tarp covering one third of the bike. Rub clean squirt oil pump up WD40 massage kick and away they go coughing and sputter ing themselves back from the grave, why can't the Superduke behave. Its like the uncoachable little leaguers.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=DribbleDuke" alt=DribbleDuke> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">DribbleDuke</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2019-06-20 08:45:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2019-06-20 08:45:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Having sorted all the little issues/niggles on mine I sat back contented...

Well what I do not like is the little bit less performance form stock factory creations. There was a thread started that begged the question from a person who resides in the town in which I was born, Livermore Ca., "Do the cheap E-Bay exhausts from Eastern Europe have enough quality to make them a good purchase?" My remark to said poster was buy the used Akrapovic you won't be disappointed. He didn't and they kept begging my attention, they got it and now they sit in my garage waiting for my machined parts that were missing to show up. So all that searching and posting and PayPal transacting was now for not.<br>Soon to be scAring mother's and children in Tennessee.<br>Yes Tennessee. My original house purchase fell through from me being too greedy. So I bought a lot site unseen In Elizabethton TN.<br>I planned to build a little house and big shop, yes that is the word planned. Planned all the way up to the point in time when I flew back to check out my land acquisition and as I was putting that town in my rearview rental car mirror I chanced upon a for sale by owner house that is perfect for my needs. It is little house with a huge lot right across the street is a river.The Doe river. Anyone want to buy a lot three blocks away from my new house?<br>I'm selling my house in Ca. as I cannot afford maintaining both and live the life style I have become accountable to.<br>The new house closes in November, possibly sooner so I will pack up a few items and winter in Tn.<br>I am pleased that I bought the SD and that bike and more likely my Duke II are going to be a kick in the pants up some of those Hollow Roads.<br>As a side plus when I was early to the Knoxville airport on my way home I had time to do Hiway 129 to the tail of the dragon in a rental car. Yes it was a fuckinblast. Drive it like you rented it.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=DribbleDuke" alt=DribbleDuke> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">DribbleDuke</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2019-10-08 22:32:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2019-10-08 22:32:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>I was in myrtle beach mid August and was wondering how you are going to like the south. <br>I know, botts dotts and curves...</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=SDNerd" alt=SDNerd> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">SDNerd</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2019-10-09 00:40:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2019-10-09 00:40:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
