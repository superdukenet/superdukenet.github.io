Or many things....sharp turn-in, stable in turn, brakes great into turns, the power spread, the "feel" of the motor including feeling each power pulse in the butt when you drive at mid-rpm. This is my third summer on it and I have not had 3 summers on the same bike in 10 years. <br><br>But...I love trying bikes. So I tried the new Speed Triple yesterday. I was surprised, I thought I remembered the old Speed Triple engine to be raw and tight feeling, on the new Speed Triple I felt isolated from the engine and did not feel the hard pull at low RPM that I remembered. Last time I rolled in on a Tuono Factory, this time my Superduke, maybe that is the difference.<br><br>The new Street Triple frame tracks great - none of the wander that the old frame had, which really needed constant correction. The old one never "carved" through a turn. The new Street Triple does. BUT, it is much heavier than the Superduke in transistions. The Superduke may be perceived as "old", but when I jumped back on it it felt tighter, lighter (it is, by quite a bit), more responsive, and it definitely was saying "flog me and raise hell" much more than the Speed Triple. I really expected much more "excitement" from the Speed Triple than it delivered. <br><br>The KTM marketing machine never really got the Superduke going the way it should have. They don't get how the magazines work. They did not need a big redesign to get press. Tweaking the spring rates, changing the sub-frame so they could change the seat a bit and offer a solo seat (that would not fit the old ones.....that's how marketing works!), slight change in the headlight/instruments (with associated marketing blab "Cleaner air around the rider's head, a bit more protection in cooler weather, blah blah blah), a little adjustment in the pegs, just little things that could be perceived as the Superduke getting some attention at KTM. This would not be expensive for KTM, and it's what the magazines want to be able to have something "new" to write about. And they want and need new things to write about, that is what keeps them in business. <br><br>Anyway, the SD still rules for me. Next up I have to try the Ducati Streetfighter. Not because I'm bored with the SD, just to see how the latest and greatest from the other compare.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/PaddyField.svg" alt="Paddy Field"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Paddy Field</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-07-25 11:26:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>fair enough - sounds like the SD is still on top.<br><br><br>You have a few SDs where there should be STs in the 2nd paragraph though </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/KTM666.svg" alt=KTM666> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">KTM666</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-07-25 12:10:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I wanted to try the new Speed Triple, but after turning up at my local dealer and seeing it in the flesh, I had to walk away in disgust as there was NO WAY I was going to ride a bike that FUGLY </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/blb.svg" alt=blb> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">blb</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-07-25 19:48:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Sorry about the confusion where I first inadvisedly was using ST and SD in the same thread, inviting confusion, but to make matters worse I was writing them incorrectly!

The Tuono is a nice bike, but it's also the same bike my friend's wife rides. Just saying word Tuono makes me feel like a sissy. Go ahead and try it. Say "I ride an Aprillia Tuono". How does it make you feel? Now walk up to a hot biker chick that probably plays roller derby and say it. Now you get the picture. Ducati got it right the first time with Monster. Then MV one up'd them with the Brutale. Why did KTM choose the word "Duke"? I don't know maybe because of Dukes of Hazard, Duke from GI Joe, Duke from Duke Nukem, Duke from I'm a badass who's parents named me Duke? My friend says the SD looks like something bat man would ride, and I said "yes, it strikes fear into the hearts of men.".</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Dutch.svg" alt=Dutch> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Dutch</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-07-26 10:49:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Yes, you are right, I should try the V4 Tuono.
