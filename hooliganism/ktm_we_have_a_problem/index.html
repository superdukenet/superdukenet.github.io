I have a KTM 1290 r on order for June/July delivery. I have been monitoring the forum topics closing and trying to learn. This is my first KTM. I am nervous to be honest. I notice that many KTM owners old and new seem to complain about similar defects or issues on their bikes. Doesn't KTM monitor or track issues concerning their bikes and customer feedback? Surely, if customers complain about the same issue/defect that they would adjust the build on the next batch of bikes. Doesn't dealers provide feedback about what bikes are coming back and the issue, for example oil leaks. <br><br>Someone save me and tell me that KTM is responsive to customer complaints. I would assume that my bike in July should not have the same issues experience by someone who got their bike in February...right?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SDNerd.svg" alt=SDNerd> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SDNerd</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-03-15 19:32:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Of course your bike will have the same issues as all the first arrival bikes. Non of these will be addressed until the next generation of 1290s next year. That's why so many people opt to wait for the second version and let all the lessons be learned by the first wave of owners. This is the way it is. <br><br>Unless a problem is so bad that it requires a recall, (and this is only usually done when there is a safety issue), then it will be down to the owners to overcome or overlook the issues. Don't worry too much, the problems and criticisms about the new 1290 are not that serious, you only have to read the threads to see that most owners are really happy. Biggest complaint from non-owners is the price for what it is but if you decided that's what you think it's worth then you already have made that decision.<br><br>The mark 2 will undoubtably be a better, improved bike but then again, some would argue that the first is best. 06 superduke owners claim that, despite its faults, is a superior bike to the later, updated model.<br><br>Ktm is no better or worse than other manufacturers in this respect. They do build bikes of high quality designed to appeal to their market and I, for one, are a fan of their philosophy and they would have to do something much worse to make me think otherwise.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-03-15 20:01:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>have had my 1290 for over a month now...no problems at all....absolutely great bike...youll have no regrets</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AGRO.svg" alt="AGRO!"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AGRO!</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-03-15 20:04:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I agree with all of Bic's remarks except that regarding this being the case a issue for all manufacturers.
