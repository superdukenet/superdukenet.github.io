At about 700 miles from new I noticed the tach needle was scraping the tach face and leaving dust-size plastic fragments inside the housing. They asked me how many miles I expected the motorcycle to have on the scheduled installation date. I told them, and after one trip around the block when I arrived, my mileage was exactly what the new odometer was programmed to read. No paperwork was required regarding the odometer reading. That was back in 2009, so maybe procedures have changed. At the time my motorcycle was still under warranty, so maybe that helped expedite things. If you can find a dealer that will do the swap this way, it makes things very easy. <br><br>Before my SDR I had a Ducati Monster (also under warranty at the time) with electrical troubles that were going to require replacement of the ECU, which resides in the guage cluster on the '07 S2R 800, or at least that's what this particular very incompetent dealer said. They also said the new cluster would read zero, and I would have to tape the old reading someplace to keep track of the mileage. The ECU/guages were replaced, but that didn't fix the problem, so the original guages were reinstalled and I never had to deal with the odometer hassle. That dealer sucked and the motorcycle had too many problems, so I sold it when I got the KTM. I think the outcome of an odometer replacement is more dependent on dealer competence than the brand. At the time I lived in Reno, Nevada, and the KTM dealer there always gave excellent service.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/NolaNomad.svg" alt=NolaNomad> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">NolaNomad</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2017-10-01 23:34:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SarasotaSteve.svg" alt=Sarasota_Steve> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Sarasota_Steve</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2017-10-02 00:01:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SarasotaSteve.svg" alt=Sarasota_Steve> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Sarasota_Steve</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2018-05-18 13:37:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Update:<br><br>It started again.

He told me it would take approximately 1 hour and I replied I'd stick around. 30 minutes later the sales person I've been dealing with comes out and says they could not change the mileage on my new speedo because this bike is not RBW (Ride by Wire). Duh! I thought but said nothing. They claim they could've done it on a RBW bike but not on mine.<br>They called KTM NA in Ohio and left a voicemail. They said they would do the right thing and compensate me for my time. I spent 5 fookin' hours with this shit today.<br>David called me a few minutes ago after getting a call back from KTM Customer Service and he said he spoke to an employee, who's fairly new at KTM, but there is an older gentleman that has been working there for 20 or so years that can re-program the speedometer.<br>What David thinks they are going to do is ... wait for it .... re-program a new speedometer and send it to me, and I'll send the one with 0 miles back (What a fookin' concept!)<br>They say that they requested the present mileage on the bike so they would make a note in my VIN to avoid speedometer fraud. But they typically do not re-program the new units.<br>I'm now waiting for another phone call early next week to see what they decide to do.
