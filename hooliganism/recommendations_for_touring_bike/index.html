Budget is £5000 max. I want something that affords some weather and wind protection and I can do 400 miles on in a day with a tank range of say 180 miles good on Autobahn and in the twisty roads.<br><br><br>Ive no experience of this type of bike and generally loathe anything with a fairing. I know nothing ticks all boxes.<br><br>Bikes I was thinking were:-<br><br>Triumph 1050 Tiger<br>Triumph 1050 Sprint<br>BMW 1150ST<br>BMW 1150RS <br>BMW 1150GS<br>VFR 800<br><br>I think the newer BMW1200's might be out of my budget.<br>I think the taller bikes would be the most fun but the least comfortable in poor weather and wind. The newer (2004+) BMW1150 twin sparked engines seem ok from reviews. Back home I may take the Mrs on short jaunts in the country so need to bear that in mind.<br><br>I've also thought of stuff like Pan European, Honda Blackbird,etc They would work but are heavy and I don't think they are bikes for me.<br><br>Any suggestions or comments on the above list good and bad would be appreciated.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/StupidLuke.svg" alt="Stupid Luke"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Stupid Luke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-18 12:48:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I have been thinking along the same lines and plan to do some distance riding this year. I rode the new Multistrada, Tiger 1050 and KTM 990 SMT. Really wanted to like the Multistrad but couldnt, Tiger 1050 was ok but not great and the SMT was too like my Superduke in lots of ways but not enough like it in others. If I owned one I could see it would soon have firmer suspension, the slipper clutch, motobox etc from my SDR in fact why stop there it would end up with the SDR's engine too.<br><br>I looked at VFR1200 but they are really fugly and have a few niggles, tank range etc that might be a nuisance far from home.<br><br>Sprint ST would be my choice if you have to spend the full 5k. I rode the Spring GT too which is a bit bigger and better equipped and may just be in your budget. I would still have the ST though as I dont intend to carry a pillion and want the sports as much as the touring out of a sports tourer. Again the engine is a bit tame and I would probably end up trying to Tune ECU it into a Street Triple with a comfy seat. Also I wasnt keen on the old style clocks, forks and last centuries brakes. If I am having these things I dont want to spend 5k which brings me to my current favourite; FZS1000. Avail for 2k upwards, 3k gets you a nice one. 150bhp engine, goes well, stops well. Quite easy to find a well looked after one. Also, unlike my RC8 it would be different enough from my SDR that it might actually get used. <br><br>The only other thing in the running for me is the new Kawasaki Z1000SX I am going out on one next Wed. Little out of your budget as the early ones (2011) are just over 6k. However, They will want my RC8 plus 2k for a used one with ABS and boxes and as I just said that 2k could buy me a FZS1000.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/steeeve66.svg" alt=steeeve66> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">steeeve66</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-18 13:03:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>My 'touring' bike is an '04 Fazer FZS1000, different to the bikes you list but might be worth a look? The main mechanicals are pretty much bulletproof although there are a few minor niggles; the Exup needs regular servicing and some of the fixings Yam used appear to have been made from the most ferrous materials known to man. But it's all day comfortable; as fast, if not faster, than most other bikes up to around 110mph and not too far off the pace when the road tightens. <br>Simon Hargeaves from Bike Magazine raves about them.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/lawman.svg" alt=lawman> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">lawman</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-18 13:23:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Thanks interesting you both mention the FZ!<br><br>My friend has a FZ1 (I think) its like a naked bike, it runs and rides well. I'll have a look, I'm sure I can blag a ride on it. He has toured on it but had to add some homemade frame to hang panniers on.<br>The reason I didn't really look at them is because I thought the lack of protection may be an issue after a couple of hundred miles and I'd feel like I had gome through ten rounds with Mike Tyson when I got off, on the plus they would be a fair sunday ride bike. <br><br>How do you find comfort after long days??<br><br>I think the new sprint has a longer wheelbase and is a bit less sporty than the older ones, plus I like the older underseat triple exhaust.

I rode a top spec one with all the gear and was unimpresed. It was ok but lacked the sharpness of the SD whilst still not being a great tourer and it was very expensive too. I wrote a report for this site called "ever wondered what an SMT is like" or something like that and I moved on...<br><br>In the end I bought a 2008 ZZR1400 with all the Givi touring kit you can possibly imagine. This came in under the 5K budget you mentioned with some haggling. The Mrs finds it comfortable as do I, it will cruise all day at whatever speed you like, overtakes (even loaded) are never stressful, it goes a fair way on a tank of gass and it even handles really well once you have adusted to the required technique. I kept the SD for solo amusement but I doubt there is a better mile munching hyper bike out there thatn a ZZR 1400 for any price. It eats rear tyres and your licence is obviously in danger unless you have mastered extreem restraint but if you want to go further, faster in more comfort than anybody else on two wheels look no further. I'm certain it would be a lot more relaxing than any unfaired bike but it does suffer from being coprehensivly ugly.<br><br>Good luck whatever you choose.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/lawman.svg" alt=lawman> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">lawman</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-18 21:46:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I have looked at the Vstrom and the ZZR1400.

But it true, and it is a very stout bike for luggage and a passenger. I had it out today. Every time I glanced down at the speedo it was over 80 MPH. It has e-nuf wind protection for me, but I know, it's not for everyone. <br>The ride today was a quick shake down ride. I just made a swap of fork tubes and a rear shock which lowered my bike. The bike I swapped with is a 2010 with 10K. Pushing 40K on mine with a 8K suspension refresh.<br>Anyway, I really like the way it feels now, even more than before, and that was still a high praise. I have other true dirt bikes and don't need to take this big bike out on the single tracks, where the taller suspension is wanted.<br><br>I saw you did not list a KTM Adventure on your list...but I am here to tell you...it should be on it. At least take one for a spin. <br>My 99 Triumph Tiger was also a nice touring bike, built to haul touring gear.

Ignore tank range as it's better to stop and fuel up often to stretch those legs.. Many people have gone around the world on small machines, Ted Simon, Vince Austin etc. all advocate a small bike.

Some also like to travel away from home and need to put the miles behind us. That is where wind protection comes in handy. Yea, you can tour on a SD, but it's not the correct tool for the job. Even the little wind screen on my Adventure will make the ride more comfortable than the wide blast you get on a SD.<br> <br>Ted used a bike because it was cheap on gas and cheap to own, not because he was a biker.

It's good to break the back of a journey via areas deemed less interesting. Once there a more sedate mileage cultural experience can be had: this is the dilemma, suffer on an inappropriate bike to munch the miles and then enjoy more when you get there or have a comfortable journey arriving refreshed and have a bike not so suitable for the smaller twisty mountain roads. That's the problem with bikes there is no one solution.<br>I used to have a KTM950SM and did Europe on that, great in parts, no so in others. It's always a compromise and I'm looking for the best one.<br><br>The BMW 1150 models thought was based upon the most modern I could afford at my budget and the fact that the R100RS cafe racer I have is surprisingly nice to ride and it's 30 years old, so the newer oilheads must be even better right?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SDNerd.svg" alt=SDNerd> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SDNerd</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-20 17:51:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/lawman.svg" alt=lawman> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">lawman</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-20 18:10:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Thanks SDnerd: I misspelt it's Frugality<br><br>This is interesting too, dont know how accurate it is though, seems about right from today's play.<br></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SDNerd.svg" alt=SDNerd> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SDNerd</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-20 19:36:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>So, a Motus MSTR it is then! <a class=postlink href="http://motusmotorcycles.com/">http://motusmotorcycles.com/</a> <br><br> </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/tripoddave.svg" alt=tripoddave> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">tripoddave</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-01-20 20:44:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I think the 1050 sprint is a great bike but if you are looking for a sports tourer for £5000 I'd take a serious look at the Kawasaki GTR1400.<br>I put 60,000 miles on one and it was faultless.
