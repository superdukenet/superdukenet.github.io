Now I may not be able to get into a full tuck because the wide bars are kicking my elbows out but I never really need to get into a full tuck unless I'm trying to hit 140mph. <br><br>So I guess my question is, when are your stretch panels supposed to stretch? Just sitting on the bike the panels above my knees are almost maxed out, however I can still move around on the bike. I obviously don't have as much range of motion as I do when I wear jeans and my Icon jacket but I don't expect to. When leaned forward in an aggressive position my back stretch panels are maxxed out as well. <br><br>So should the panels not be stretching until I'm really stretching? Should I be able to move around on the bike with out elongating the stretch panels? <br><br>I've tried a few suits on at local shops but the sales men always tell me yeah it fits you great, when it's obviously limiting my range of motion (not able to crouch down into a tuck, ect) Lots of people on the internet are saying that leather stretches which it does because my gloves we're too tight but after a season they've loosened up and fit perfectly. However I believe when they say stretch then mean it will stretch to conform to your body shape like your biceps, abdominal area, thighs and such. I don't think a suit will ever get any longer. I think from my hip socket to my knee is just too long for an off the rack fit. <br><br>I can return these and get a 50/60 but it's a different model and $200 more and I have to ship it back to Germany.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SarasotaSteve.svg" alt=Sarasota_Steve> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Sarasota_Steve</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2017-03-24 18:26:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/PBRnr.svg" alt=PBRnr> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">PBRnr</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2017-03-25 06:17:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>A moment being Cpt Obvious: stretch panels are placed strategically to allow adequate range of motion while riding the bike. I say "strategically" because the stretch panels are not as abrasion resistant as the flat/unstitched sections of leather, so they are typically placed in less often impacted/slide areas. The other part of strategic positioning is to allow them to function with your body to allow that range of motion. Different bikes, riders, and applications require different degrees of range of motion and thus: fit.<br><br>Totally my opinion, but maxing out stretch panels just to sit on a bike is a sign that the suit is too small for your body or just not designed with the bike ergos in mind. Conversely, not having the stretch panels expand AT ALL when you sit on the bike is probably saying the suit is too big (armor less likely to stay in place when you crash, folds in the leather catch the ground and cause you to tumble vs slide). Different suits are designed for different purposes often falling into street fit or race fit directions. Street fit can be a bit looser and cut for upright ergonomics whereas race fit is typically more snug (except along the back where typically folks wear additional back protector) and have a lot of pre-curve to fit the rider in the sport-tuck position, coincidentally can make you stand like a neanderthal off the bike. Somewhere in the middle is the ideal balance in comfort, function and protection.<br><br>I would NOT expect much loosening/stretching in the leather with use. Stretch panels are part of that reason: to relieve tension from the flat leather panels (less tension = less stretching effect). The elastic in the stretch panels may ease up and the leather may become more supple (if properly cared for) to allow better ease and comfort of use but will probably not ever expand to be a different size on the chart (as you wrote).<br><br>My first Dainese suit was a 2-piece Avro div and it was more street orientated. After I crashed that suit a few times till it was no longer safe to use I tried an Aero EVO 1 piece that was also a size down. Didn't work for me to size down as I had blood-blister pinch marks along my elbows and knee creases from just a few minutes sitting on a showroom bike....sizing up did the trick for me and I had a pretty good fit. I say pretty good because I think the torso is a tad short for me (if I stand up straight with it fully zipped, my nads get smashed and the collar snaps actually can pop open)...on the track, the suit disappears, letting me focus on the more important things<br><br>I think you just have to keep trying things on for yourself until you are 100% satisfied...GL!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Aphex.svg" alt=Aphex> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Aphex</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2017-03-25 23:12:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Thanks for the replies, I ended up going down to the D store and trying a bunch of suits on.

Hell even the same size and same suit will fit a bit differently. Suits are pretty much all hand made, not by a big machine somewhere. <br><br>Being in SoCal and being able to try on different suits helps a lot and allows you to really try on a few different ones and get a better feel for what fits. <br><br>The stretch panels are designed to stretch but if you have them maxed out when just sitting on the bike it's too snug. You don't want a loose fit but you do want as snug as is comfortable. The biggest thing for most new suit buyers is to try to stand up right and then complain when it's too snug. if you can wear the suit standing upright, it's probably too big unless it's designed for that (I was at AMA flat track races last night and the leather suits are cut to fit when more vertical). the Laguna Seca is a more european fit (snug and a bit thinner in the arms/legs) vs. the new Dainese Assen suit is cut a bit looser as more beginner track day guys aren't used to the snug fit.<br><br>The D-store in orange county is good- the manager Tom really knows his stuff. I've bought a few things from them when I'm in OC for work. Helps that they have a very good selection to try on. If you happen to look in the back area, the lady from Italy that does all of the top racers repairs and air bag suit fixes works back there.

Indeed, only yesterday I tried on a few suits to replace the Dainese I sold a while ago. With the Dainese I finally got fed up with how tight it was across the chest and decided I needed something more comfortable. <br>So yesterday I tried on a few suits and noticed how the trend is to put more and more protection into the things. On the surface this might seem like a good idea however, what I found was that all the new 'stuff' actually makes it far more difficult to get into. In fact, after struggling with one suit for 5 minutes to just get the legs on, I figured I was done and gave up. My thinking was that by the time I got the thing on my race would be over! So this raises the paradox of safety versus utility/comfort. <br>What I think I need now is comfort for the 99% of the time I'm in the thing and a some degree of safety for the &lt;1% of the time I'm getting intimate with the black stuff. Are manufacturers taking safety too far? Indeed, are accepted norms no longer necessary? I want a suit that has no liner because all it does is get tangled - I just use a compression suit and that is much easier to deal with.<br>I notice a few tracks are insisting that metal be removed from boots Etc to reduce sparks. Clearly, this is because of the fire risk and track damage Etc. but I'm not sure how that stack up against a bike on it's side.<br>Are one-pieces really being designed for what most of us want?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/PBRnr.svg" alt=PBRnr> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">PBRnr</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2017-03-30 04:28:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Good points, all.
