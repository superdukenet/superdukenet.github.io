For first time wheelies the advice which worked the best was to find a level bit of road with minimal camber. First gear, accelerate and when the revs hit 4K just twist the throttle back open. The front wheel will lift and then it's all down to phycology as a novice will instinctively want to shut off as they are scared and think they will flip. It's not the bike - it's in your head that prevents wheelies . As you get your confidence up you will realise that what feels high is not really and you will gradually be going up higher and landing smooth. It is all about practice. I just go out on my own in the countryside and do them at every first gear opportunity if there is no traffic around. I've got better but still haven't got to changing up to second.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=THEDUKE" alt=THEDUKE> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">THEDUKE</h3> <time datetime="2011-05-21 08:44:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-05-21 08:44:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Lowrance" alt=Lowrance> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Lowrance</h3> <time datetime="2011-05-21 09:01:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-05-21 09:01:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>I starting trying to wheelie about a year and a half or so ago and even if i do say so myself my sitting wheelies are getting pretty nice now.<br><br>I started by watching a guy on youtube called downshift82 <a class=postlink href="http://www.youtube.com/user/downshift83">http://www.youtube.com/user/downshift83</a><br>He started a little before me but had the same bike hes alot further on than me now but he definatly has time to practice more than me too but i clutch up in 2nd gear and hit rev limiter now so i need to either start rocking or shifting gears.<br><br>Anyway first thing you want to do it Cover the rear brake (SO IMPORTANT) although not as important on our V-Twins as the engine breaking will get you out of shit 99% of the time.<br><br>Start by being in first gear find a quite straight road roll the throttle on and as you get to the power band bang the throttle on the front will raise and at first youll let off staraight away but once you get used to the feeling try and bang the throttle on then let off a little then hold it on so you keep the front up for a short distance (this should only be about a foot off the floor so no where near looping height.<br><br>Once you get used to the feeling of the front being off the floor and feel very comfy in this you want to start clutching. Its alot more controlled than powering up so now be in second (ive got a 40T rear and i goto about 4k revs) get to the power band again and you want to blip the clutch in with one/two fingers just pull in then drop out all in one smooth motion whilst doing this pulling on the throttle (not too much) the first few times you do this the bike will just lurch forward.<br><br>Once you have it lurching throttle a little more (its a very hard technique to show or explain its just practice and youll get the right feel) once its coming up chase the wheelie with the throttle so you stay up and long as you can.<br><br>Once you start getting better you'll reach the point that im at which is where you pop straight up to the balance point (DONT TRY AND GET HERE TOO QUICK) like i said its taken me a year to get here it can be done quicker but just dont try and go from never wheeling to being at balance point as chances are you WILL LOOP IT. Anyway youll pop it up to balance point which is the weirdest feeling as the bike goes weightless you cant feel any weight to the bike its like your sat on air then use minor adjustments in throttle to keep youself the safe side of the blance point but not dropping and not too much to loop it. Youll eventually run out of revs doing it this way and hit the limiter in 2nd which will just drop you down.<br><br>So thats the point im at now so i need to start either using gear changes while its up or tipping it further up and using the rear brake to bring it back down.<br><br>Its a fairly simple trick really just takes time and practice but looks one of the best looking things ever.<br><br>NOTE: dont try clutch in 1st unless you are VERY steady with the throttle as it will either come up very quikly and you could loop or if your not smooth in the technique youll end up doing a rolling burnout!</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=mattblack" alt=matt_black> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">matt_black</h3> <time datetime="2011-05-21 13:55:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-05-21 13:55:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Lowrance" alt=Lowrance> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Lowrance</h3> <time datetime="2011-05-21 17:46:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-05-21 17:46:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Yup, Bailz put it best. It is a move that takes practice, practice, practice. <br><br>Do you have a mountain bike or even a BMX bike? IMHO these are the easiest(and least costly) way to learn the feel of the balance point, and also how to use the rear brake to keep from going over. <br><br>You can also try it on a dirtbike, if you have access to one. Start slow, WEAR GEAR, and don't expect to be Chris Pfeiffer overnight. The more patient you are with them, the easier they will get. <br><br>Oh yeah; when the front end comes up, don't just look at the bars/guage cluster....look well off in front of you.

You should be learning to do this because you enjoy it, not because others think it looks cool.<br><br>For a bike like the SD there is no need for the clutch in the lower gears.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=DaveySprocket" alt="Davey Sprocket"> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Davey Sprocket</h3> <time datetime="2011-05-22 10:36:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-05-22 10:36:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>I think there are pluses and minuses to both clutch and power up wheelies<br><br>Obviously power ups are easy to get the wheel up but can be alot harder to control as you raise the wheel and the front gets higher the less power you need to raise it even higher so if you just power on and hold it at that it will start coming up slowly and as you approach balance point will raise very quickly this makes it quite hard to then back off the throttle and rethrottle at a point that will hold you there and obviously powering up like this means if ur not ready for it you can loop quite easy when powering on towards the balance point as the speed it approaches this point is so much quicker than the initial lift.<br><br>Also if you power up in say 2nd gear at 4k rpm by the time you hit balance point your going faster and at 7k or so rpm or more where as if u clutch up in 2nd at 4k rpm your at balance point straight away at 4k rpm and whatever speed u were doing. Obviously the technique for clutch needs practice but once you have it there's no way you should wear clutches more than just riding (maybe chains) but clutch is ultimately the way to go long term but as has been said practice power ups first get used to the feeling then try clutches only when your comfy with the feeling of being mono<br><br>Think about professional stunt riders they only ever clutch up the only time they use power up is for stunts they don't need balance point control for (like a wheelie sat on the bars) and I spoke to a stunter who did displays and he uses the same bike for practice as well as shows and he's not changed a clutch in his bike he's used for 2 years so proves if you use the right technique your clutch will be fine!</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=DaveySprocket" alt="Davey Sprocket"> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Davey Sprocket</h3> <time datetime="2011-05-22 10:56:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-05-22 10:56:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>There was a long thread on this subject last year some time that might be useful if you can find it.<br><br>Here are the main points from my experience to make things easier and as risk free as possible.<br><br>Flat level piece of straight road without traffic<br><br>Relaxed, upright body position. Don't lock arms or pull on the bars.<br><br>Second gear, roll up to 4K, dip clutch, full throttle, release clutch. The clutch movement is in just enought to disengage and then release immediatly<br><br>Look well ahead - this is essential. If you look at the clocks, bars or front wheel you will freak. Look well ahead and it's all much more gentle<br><br>The key is timing the clutch dip with the throttle but you will feel this through practice.<br><br>On the SD in my experience the back brake is not needed as angine braking will slam the wheel down when you close the throttle.<br><br>Once you get the swing of it you might remember to press up in the gear lever, a small dip of throttle will then see her change into third while still up. My experience is that full throttle in third allows the front to float down gently and makes for a long, elegant and impressive looking wheelie. Some people can just change up through the box while still on one wheel but they have better ballance and bigger bollocks than me!<br><br>Hope that helps a little.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=REDZX" alt="RED ZX"> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">RED ZX</h3> <time datetime="2011-05-22 14:59:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-05-22 14:59:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Awesome!! Thanks guys.. I'm in JHB in South Africa so we suffer from about 25% less power here due to altitude.. So i think just getting it up with standard gearing on the throttle might be a bit tough.. I am planning on going up to 40t rear sprocket so hoping that will help.. Also waiting for my LSL damper to arrive, I tend to hold onto the bars like a vice grip so i'm hoping it will help keep the bike a little stable when the wheel rises and when it drops.. I tried to wheelie some 600c bikes when I was younger.. but never got it right..

Great fun. He got good at it and took the training wheels off and did not tell me. It was on for a long time and I got use to it there all the time. Well, you can see where this is going. Yep, I jumped on the bike pulled it up waiting to ride the wheels, and no friking training wheels! Flat on my back! Luckly it was in the back yard grass, but down hill with a little speed. And yet another story. My buds son goes to the coast with his buds and dirt bikes. They were on the hard packed shore riding the wheel, and he gets off at speed, rang his bell real loud. Next thing he knows he is riding in the truck and asking where we going. His buds say, read the note you are holding in your hands. The buds got so tired of telling him what happened and where they were going, they wrote a note for him to hold and read. I keep the wheel down most of the time but have dreams of riding the wheel. In the dreams I can ride as far and as long as I want. Did manage (for real) to pull a nice long one on my Honda XR650R about 10 miles to the finish on a DS ride. Up hills are best for me. Anyway, lofted a nice power wheely and ran out of steam. Damn if there was not a pointed rock connected to the center of Earth that I had to land on. Bent my front rim so bad that I thought I would for sure pinch the tube. Did not want to fix a flat so picked up the pace. The guy putting on the event noticed the rim on return, it was that bad. Ok, one more. So I had this 87 1100 GSXR. Take my gal on a mountian pass ride and needed to get around a slow poke. Make the pass slower than usuall because she was a little green. So then noticed another car coming around the bend and had to gas it. Lofted the front wheel. Shitttt. Hit the rear brake to bring er down. Still out in the wrong lane, gas it again another wheel ride till I got out of harms way. One more wheely with her when we banged helments bring er down and that was it. She will not ride with me any more.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=DaveySprocket" alt="Davey Sprocket"> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Davey Sprocket</h3> <time datetime="2011-05-23 18:21:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-05-23 18:21:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=wille" alt=wille> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">wille</h3> <time datetime="2011-05-23 20:02:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-05-23 20:02:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=scamb66" alt=scamb66> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">scamb66</h3> <time datetime="2011-05-25 00:48:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-05-25 00:48:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>There was a video posted here (from a member I think) doing clutchless wheelies in 1st, 2nd, 3rd and even 4th with a bit of help of the road.

A good part of the advise here was correct, spelling excluded. Try just rolling the bike up in first with the throttle...all you have to do is open it up all the way! The bike is so light with so much torque that as the instruments come up in your face, with some practice you can just dip the throttle and pull on the shift lever with no clutch and catch second. Then if you are lower in the power band you can gradually bring the bike up close to the balance point, and do the same thing in into third. My friends called my 690 Supermoto the Unicycle..but they are amazed that the SD can be ridden just the same way...I'm 53 years old now, but I started practicing when I was 21 years old and had no sense of mortality...on stuff like a Honda 400 hawk! Fan the clutch when shifting into second at low rev's, and it snaps up to the balance point... then to click the next gear, you bring it up just a bit higher and then dip the throttle and snick the next gear...All so simple to write...but the most applicable advise for someone who isn't just naturally talented is to practice, practice, practice....</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=rob1botes" alt=rob1botes> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">rob1botes</h3> <time datetime="2011-05-26 03:15:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-05-26 03:15:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>If no one else said it here, I will: get an old DS bike, and practice in the grass!!</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=cloonster" alt=cloonster> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">cloonster</h3> <time datetime="2011-05-27 08:02:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-05-27 08:02:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Hey davey sprocket &amp; rob1, i grew up in honeydew, back in my day and that whole area was pure dirt roads.

Then use that away from lights, junctions etc. Once you get comfy with that start lifting it off every hump-back bridge, ridge in the road in whatever gear you're in. Just get used to the front wheel being in the air. After that you can clutch them up.. I've sort of learned over a year or so and the best bit of advice I can give you is this. Don't practice. Just do it on your ride out. React. If you think too hard you will over think it.
