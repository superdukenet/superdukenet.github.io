I love these machines, and I love the KTM brand... but I've been hanging on to this bike for all the wrong reasons, almost out of nostalgia and not being able to bring myself to leave the Superduke fold. It's such a great bike to own, even if you're not on it. LOL.<br><br>Reasons are complex, but basically my riding is changing.<br><br>The SDR is the best bike for the <span style="text-decoration: underline">old me</span>. Aggressive, loud, in a fooking hurry, and grinning like the devil on PCP... but as time goes by I'm becoming less angry and prefer to ride smooth instead of fast. As some of you noticed, I picked up a (cough, splutter) for slow summer rides (85-bhp at the wheel, LOL) and to my horror, I've discovered that not only am I faster round Brands Hatch on it, but that it's also better through town, and it's even easier and less demanding to ride as an every day bike, despite being an air-cooled, twin-shock retro roadster. It corners faster too. <br><br>This isn't about the bike tho, it's about me. When faced with both sets of keys I opt for jeans, piss-pot lid and the Ducati keys. Also, I'm 45, with 2 kids, and my biking tastes are becoming more about lifestyle than the latest power commander, TuneECU, or which widget will give me another 3 bhp. I want timeless biking, not this year's latest bike. I don't really care about a 1200 SDR, and that's weird.<br><br>Also, the Dutchess was knocked off her Buell a few weeks ago, and though she's on the mend, it reminded more how mortal we all are, and while any bike is dangerous, I'm well aware that the super duke has always made me ride like a cnut. Time to chill a little, I think, and you just can't chill on an SDR.<br><br><br>So... I still love my Superduke, and if I was a little more financially stable I'd keep it, just to hang on to a modern classic, but it's crazy to hang on to such a high spec machine as a "second bike" while I spend my bike-money on an old cafe racer.<br><br>I'm not in a rush to get rid of it and I want the right price (the mods and spec are ridiculous), so as this isn't the best time of year to sell, I may still have it through winter. ...and if you'll let me, I'd love to hang out here still, and keep meeting up with the mates I've made on road and track.<br><br><br>One final comment: Out of all the biker-types out there, Superduke riders are the maddest, quickest, and most opinionated, individualistic, loonies I have ever met.<br>So many good riders, so many decent fellas, so much knowledge, trust, passion...<br>I'm more distressed about leaving a brotherhood of like-minded nutters than I am about losing the bike. It's a very exclusive, very special club. I will definitely have regrets, and I can barely bring myself to press the Submit button.<br><br><img src="http://i871.photobucket.com/albums/ab275/LondonDutch/BrandsSDRWide-1.jpg" alt=Image><br><br><img src="http://i871.photobucket.com/albums/ab275/LondonDutch/SideViewFSFavouringRear-1.jpg" alt=Image><br><br><img src="http://i871.photobucket.com/albums/ab275/LondonDutch/FullTiltFINAL-1.jpg" alt=Image></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/stalker.svg" alt=stalker> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">stalker</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-16 19:23:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/samba.svg" alt=samba> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">samba</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-16 19:28:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>old fart </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Dutch.svg" alt=Dutch> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Dutch</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-16 19:40:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Schnauzer.svg" alt=Schnauzer> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Schnauzer</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-16 20:40:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I kinda felt you'd get here after your <span style="font-style: italic">shall I, shall I not</span> thread!

I've got 15 years on you and I just got my SD this spring because I <span style="font-style: italic">needed</span> something outrageous. I've been riding my R1150RS since new; it's a great bike, travels well, doesn't need much attention, but... It's been awhile since I've had anything fast. <br>I rarely ride the SD to work, the beemer is much better for that, but when I need to get my ya-yas, nothing else does it like the Duke. I always come home with a smile on my face and feeling much better than when I left. I don't ride it like an old fart either, it makes me do things I never would have considered on other bikes. <br>A few years down the road when you're done with the kids you will probably find your tastes changing again, and who knows what will push your button at that point, bicycle touring, fly fishing, or whatever.<br>BTW, I love the stuff on Bikeexif, I have an old R100 that is going to get some kind of cafe treatment after I figure out what I want it to look like.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Dutch.svg" alt=Dutch> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Dutch</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-17 07:58:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content><span style="color: #004000">It made me laugh a bit Dutch when you said that your 45 like your getting old LOL !!<br>I'm 55 and stopped riding sport bikes last year got sick of leaning down. The good thing with us humans is that we all like different stuff and it would be sad if every one was on the same type of bike. As for the Super Duke it brings out the worst in you! I thought that I would ride slower when I got mine but it has had the opposite affect DOH!! Anyho make sure you stick around as I'm still a member on one of the Hayabusa forums, So I ride a different bike now but who cares its a bike right! and that's the main thing.

I can't wait to see what it does when I don't have to worry about cops and blue haired old ladies trying to kill me. It's funny I almost bought an SDR went for the standard thought I would just ride the street.Now I am going to be a track junkie.Who knew?<br>What ever you decide just know make your self happy we are only here once.I have had two major health scares in the last couple of years. It could have changed everything.<br>I am living for me now I have raised my kids it is my time now I want to go out doing what I love with no regrets.<br>Good luck my brother you will always be a duke guy no matter what you ride you have earned that for sure.Enjoy yourself<br>Vic<br>I wish I knew how to post utube stuff my bro did some cool video with the footage from our rides with my go pro.I think he is at chriscrash488 on u tube the parker run or topock if you can check it out The first one I was still a little gun shy from my 30 over ticket the second one I took off my tank bag and went for it.I would love to post it for you guys but I am not good at puter stuff.<br>Once again good luck bro BTW that duc is very nice</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Dutch.svg" alt=Dutch> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Dutch</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-17 11:59:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Thanks for all the replies guys.I really appreciate your comments, and yes, as for my mates, those are always gonna be there. I'm still on two wheels after all.<br><br>It's not so much an age thing. At 45 I feel pretty young for my years and I intend to keep riding for as many years as possible, it's more about the fact that a new type of biking has come onto my radar, that is even more about the lifestyle, and ticks boxes that one-model and one-make can't tick. I've also lost my passion for outright bhp, and gained a new passion for lightness and handling. The Superduke is a big bike (ok, I'm only 5'9") and while it's brilliantly flickable in a SuperMoto kinda way, it's limited.<br><br>I've also lost interest in owning the newest thing out there. The Tuono leaves me cold, as does any bike that needs rider-aids to keep it upright. It's like the Eurofighter - turn off the computers and it's not even aerodynamic. <br><br>Anyway, the SDRs not gone yet.... Let's see if anyone is even buying bikes at this time of year!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Schnauzer.svg" alt=Schnauzer> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Schnauzer</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-17 13:11:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/StupidLuke.svg" alt="Stupid Luke"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Stupid Luke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-17 13:29:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-17 18:16:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Schnauzer.svg" alt=Schnauzer> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Schnauzer</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-17 18:35:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/StupidLuke.svg" alt="Stupid Luke"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Stupid Luke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-17 19:21:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Was worth it to see the picture of Bic as a lesbian though </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DaveySprocket.svg" alt="Davey Sprocket"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Davey Sprocket</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-17 19:29:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>One scary point <span style="font-weight: bold">dutch is faster on the Ducati </span>??? doesn't that pose the question.... is the SDR and SD that good on the track?

You can most always come back, you just have to search harder. If your SDR was a bit much, get the SD next round. Short shift it and be happy to know if you really need to clean the cob webs out, it' just a twist of the wrist away. And more bikes in your shed, the better. And don't forget to look in to different types of bikes. Dual sport bike are a real kick, and yea I got my eyes on a 06 SM with the origional rear tyre still on the bike <br>Thanks for your input on my build.

Two mods biting the dust in less than a week. Is this a mutiny? <br><br>And slowing down? I bought my SD to slow down. I spent too many rides going mach snell on the GSXR to think about. That damn thing always had me creeping over the tonne. With the SD, when the wind hits me at 90 mph its a big wake up call. Time to slow the fook down. That said, I think when I have to get a bike with less performance than the SD, I'll likely quit all together. That has nothing to do with me though. I'm slow as molasses in the winter. I just won't own a bike that will not out run a hot rodded pick em up truck that's trying desperately trying to run my fat BALD ass over. No more SV650s for me. Too many psychos in pickups on the road around here.<br><br>Dutch, none of that crap applies to you. Everyone has to live their own lives and do the things that make them happy.

I do not have the disposable income to keep the garage filled with all riding pleasures and can see how you pick for replacement excited you.<br>It is not as if you went to three wheels or stamp collecting. I am wondering how it is that an air cooled twin that had a racing heritage and symbalizes nostalgia of the cafe race era differs from assless chaps playing on their air cooled twins. It may be sideways but it is certainly not another story altogether. The very first introduction to the racing heritage XR1200 was first introduced by your way and the Spaniards have made a barbeque race series out of them. There are few bikes that I do not want to ride on or experiance and even the Ural, an air cooled twin has nostalgic value. Let us celebrate the twins as much as bic would have us and leave the doors open for all and ride on.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DavoSingapore.svg" alt=Davo-Singapore> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Davo-Singapore</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-18 20:52:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MADDOG53.svg" alt=MADDOG53> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">MADDOG53</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-18 22:12:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Chap<br>informal(chiefly Brit.)<br>a man or boy.<br>Yes yes Harley has a heritage of racing and it predates the XR1200<br>Ask Pascal Picotte or Chris Carr.<br>Only bring out that it is not rediculous to enjoy heritage in many shapes and forms.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Willh.svg" alt=Willh> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Willh</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-18 22:17:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Dutch.

The idea of a new fly-by-wire version with traction control and ABS just doesn't interest me at all.
