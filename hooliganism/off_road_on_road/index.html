I hear what you're saying about the relatively safe fun you can have in the dirt as opposed to the street. They both have their own addictive qualities.

Certainly not in a loss of licence and job. Also I think it improves your road riding so much and you can actually go into corners on an enduro track shoulder to shoulder which on track will prob result in at best a black flag and at worst 2x written off bikes and a ride in the air ambulance. <br>Can't see me selling the SD though.

I take it you no longer use a bike to commute?<br><br>I am having the same debate though not because of the off roading which hasn’t gripped me yet (17hrs to your 30) That said, I am looking forward to enduroland / motocross tracks and a summer of dry tracks to hoon about on. <br><br>Riding thorugh shitty deep mud is no fun at all at my level of experience, neither is cleaning the bike after.<br><br>I have also questioned the need for a road bike to use purely for enjoyment (i.e far in excess of the speed limit) in the current climate of unmarked bikes and telephoto cop cameras looking to obtain a ban plus a big fine and trial by Youtube. I have reduced my road riding from 10k plus per year down to about 2k. I need my licence for work. I don’t have any fun riding at legal speeds so that isn’t an option.<br><br>Trackdays have become another pain in the arse. Since 2005/6/7 when I did about 10 per year I have decreased my attendance to about 2 per year. Mostly due to the whinging briefings and protracted noise testing. Who wants to lose money for a day off work for, at best , 7 sessions with at least 3 foreshortened by unnecessary red flags? So it is a no brainer, the ZX636 B1H that hasn’t turned a wheel since last May ought to go on e bay.<br><br>However, I still like to do a couple of Lyddens per year, plus a few spontaneous road rides so I do need a road bike. The only thing I would willingly swap my SDR for would be an earlier 2005/6 SD if I needed the money.<br><br>Insuring 2 bikes isn’t much dearer than insuring one. Tax on an off roader is peanuts. Unless you have to get rid I would say stay as you are. A 690 is neither, one thing, or the other and would be found wanting on or off road. In future years you may need to get a cheaper road and off road bike but I would still say it is worth having two separate bikes rather than a jack of all trades master of none. Likewise a 450EXC with road wheels will be a boring, gutless, uncomfortable bike that cant keep up with anyone you know…except Freestyler </div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Schnauzer" alt=Schnauzer> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Schnauzer</h3> <time datetime="2011-04-27 21:13:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-04-27 21:13:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>I love both, I know at times when I've only had one that I've missed the other one.<br>I can't say that one is better, they're just two different kettles of fish, I love them both.<br><br>My 13 yo daughter has started dirt riding in the last 12mths, and I'm having so much fun showing her the ropes.<br><br>So my opinion is ,if you can afford it, keep them both.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=ColonelKlinck" alt=Colonel_Klinck> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Colonel_Klinck</h3> <time datetime="2011-04-27 21:32:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-04-27 21:32:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Good points ther Luke, i can only agree. To clarify, i would not replace both with a 690, only the SDR. I do not want to be rid of a pure off roader! So far the EXC is a revelation to me and I love the thrills of off roading albeit with heaps of fear/testosterone/sliding/jumping (a little) and even wheelies (which i enjoy more on the EXC).<br><br>I am genuinely thinking about this and really appreciate the feedback guys.

With a new kid I just don't have the time for track days and dirt riding. And I haven't put in any decent road riding in three years (commuting blows in the big city and I have to ride 80mi's to find two consecutive curves and then 80 more to find another two). Trying to keep up with parts, tyres, maintenance, insurance of two bikes is time consuming and expensive. In my single days no problem. Time and money was all mine. All that droning out of the way now I can say I already miss track days and the season is just getting started here. Technically I haven't even missed a track day yet!<br><br>Dirt riding is a kick in the ass no doubt! You get to do all the things you wish you could do on a street bike with 1/1000th of the consequences. Slide it, wheelie it, go as fast as your balls allow you, drop it, flip it, jump it, drop it, flip it, pick it up and keep going. I crash more and get hurt more in one hour of dirt than I ever did on a street bike but (for the most part) it's the kind of hurt you get up and ride away from. My riding season starts two months earlier and goes a month longer for dirt. But really it's not a street vs. dirt thing for me. I kinda get a pit in my stomach when I think of giving up the track and a street bike and particularly my SD. But, for now, I really needed to pick one and dirt is offering more riding to me. My plan is to keep my 250xcw for enduro and hare scrambles and get a full on MX bike for track riding.<br><br>Like someone mentioned, if the money tied up in the SDR isn't a problem just hold it for a year and get your dirt fix guilt free.
