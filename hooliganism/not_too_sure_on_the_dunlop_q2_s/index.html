Those ass-puckering moments ... Nice lines BTW. That track looks like a hooligan boot camp. <br><br>Like the others, the video suggests (to me) hard-part contact with the tarmac. But, if you say that wasn't the case, who are we to argue? Didn't see it, and weren't there on the bike.<br><br>That said, there have been times at the track where I've had similar "oh shit" moments, and was convinced I touched something down. Inspection of the bike suggested no. Then sometime later (in a couple of cases - months later!), I'd be servicing the bike and I'd see a scrape on a pipe, the frame, or some other place normally obscured from typical view of the bike. I always laugh and think "... sooooo, that's where I touched down that day ...". Hard to imagine anything being obscured like that on a SuperDuke, but who knows. That lower cowl (black plastic) may not show rash real well. <br><br>Maybe a dumb question (or 3), but what did the tyre look like after the session (or day)? Is the rear wheel properly aligned? Was there any kind of dip entering or mid-corner (didn't look like it)?<br><br>Out of curiosity, how hot was it? Any idea how hot the track surface might have been? Even the highest performance street tyres aren't designed for high sustained heat of a bike in expert hands. Not knowing how coarse that tarmac is, its hard to gauge whether that sound is characteristic for a step out, but I would expect a tyre like the Q2 to be a little more progressive in warning you first if it was as simple as a loss of traction (assuming no debris or a 'slick' spot).<br><br>Then there's the other part of this: Maybe you're beyond using a street tyre for your track sorties.

Ss nerd feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but for an SD I would expect around 30mm rider sag with 5-10mm static sag. The guys I know who track their gsxrs run 0-5mm static and 25mm rider sag. Granted gixxers have a lot less travel but I did qoute higher sag numbers. That would give you an extra 10mm of clearance pretty much as a minimum. You can make up for the extra height in the rear with your fancy height adjuster that you have just installed</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MrZ32.svg" alt=MrZ32> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">MrZ32</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-02 04:46:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Linga.svg" alt=Linga> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Linga</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-04-02 04:51:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Well at the moment he is running a lot more sag in the rear...
