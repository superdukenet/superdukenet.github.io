Specifically, the transitions between on- and off-throttle were so abrupt and dramatic that I had trouble maintaining my concentration on other factors, like line selection. Everywhere else I rode this bike, I loved the hard-hitting low-end grunt and I've always appreciated the engine-braking on twins. I've had lots of other sport bikes, but only one other with fuel injection - a Suzuki TL1000S a little over 10 years ago. That bike had a similar problem, and it was enough to ruin my fun (I wound up fleeing to a CBR600F4, but then missed the big-twin experience so much I came back to a SuperHawk).<br><br>My SD's previous owner installed FMF Apex slip-ons, MH airbox (SAS and O2 sensors removed) and a PCIII (with custom mapping), along with a softer sloping throttle cam. As far as I could tell before this last outing, fuel metering was very good all around. I didn't detect any of the low-rpm surging or other misbehavior I'd read about on stock SD's. It wasn't until I was dealing with on/off throttle transitions during multiple series of tight corners that I had any complaints, but then it was really bad. Is this something that can be addressed with further modification? Does this indicate the need for better mapping? Would the MH secondary butterflies help? Do I need a slipper clutch? Obviously, I'll be practicing my throttle control to minimize my own contribution to the situation, too.<br><br>On the positive side, the SD's handling was magnificent -- as you all know already!<br><br>Thanks in advance for your input.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SDNerd.svg" alt=SDNerd> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SDNerd</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-01 06:01:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I maybe reaching here - but I'm gonna guess that pretty much everyone on here has had if not the same, nearly the same experiences. I'm guessing, that with that set of mods, the bike has already been re-mapped. With TuneECU (free, but please donate!) - you can determine this.<br><br>Otherwise, what you describe is part of the charm. Japanese I4 600s they ain't. Not even close. That low-end instant-on torque punch is part of what makes the bike so much fun. Bike wants to lift out of every corner effortlessly - tee-hee. <br><br>OK - while these things are an acquired taste (read: not for everyone), use a lower gear(s) maybe; keep the revs up. Less braking needed on the entry just by lifting, and don't lift entirely - keep some maintenance throttle through the turn. With more revs in, its easier to control the throttle. After the apex - bring in as much throttle as quickly as you dare. Word of caution: Extreme euphoric giddiness can occur, followed by desire to repeat the experience as many times as possible. Not unlike your 'ol TL (desmoquattro, etc.), if you ride it like it was stolen, it seems to work better.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AGRO.svg" alt="AGRO!"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AGRO!</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-01 06:11:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content><span style="color: #004000">My bike is a 2009 model and the throttle was not as bad as some bike's on here.<br>But the good news is that you have all the right mods so the only other thing I would do is this <a class=postlink-local href="http://www.superduke.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=17966">viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=17966</a> and it makes a big difference.

What I do to set them is start engine let it get hot then hook up Tuneecu.<br>Now I don't set them at idle I actually put a piece of model engine fuel line in between the throttle grip and switch housing so I can keep the throttle just open from fully closed. The model engine fuel line acts like a throttle lock! At Idle the reading will be some were around the 380s to 390s on the front and rear cylinder or more. Then what I do is raise the throttle till I get a reading around 400 to 405 now because you have the throttle locked with the model engine fuel line you now have both hands free to do your adjustments. When I do mine I put the throttle up so I have a reading of 401 and then adjusted the other cylinder to the best I could get. It was switching from 401 to 402 on the other cylinder so I was happy with that. Once you are happy with setting give it a rev and then check again. Have a look at this also it shows you the adjustment screw and another method of adjustment if you don't have tuneecu. <a class=postlink-local href="http://www.superduke.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5347">viewtopic.php?t=5347</a></span></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Scribe78.svg" alt=Scribe78> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Scribe78</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-01 08:38:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Many thanks for your input. Sounds like removing the secondary flies and shafts is what I need to do. But I thought they were supposed to smooth throttle response, theoretically at least. Why would KTM go to the trouble of including them if there is only good effect from removing them? I'm not arguing against removal - I'm just curious why the effects are opposite what the marketing says. Other problematic items have "benefits" we simply consider irrelevant, like fuel economy or emissions, so we get rid of O2 and SAS. Surely there was some justification for the secondary flies, even if we prefer to do without them. <br><br>I already planned to get TuneECU and get rid of PCIII to reduce layers of electronics. There would be no advantage to retaining PCIII, right? I'd rather spend a little more and not have to build up a TuneECU cable myself. Any recommendations on a good source for a ready-to-go cable?<br><br>Thanks again!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AGRO.svg" alt="AGRO!"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AGRO!</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-01 11:19:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content><span style="color: #004000">This is what Bic said !<br><br> My understanding was that the secondary flies are more to do with intake noise for Euro legislation rather than to add any performance gains.

In case I wasn't clear in my first post, I already love this bike and chose it specifically for the thrills only big twins have to offer. I've had several other v-twin sportbikes in the past, and they've always been my favorites. With my old TL, I enjoyed it immensely in many riding situations, but I was doing a lot of tight/twisty riding and found the on/off transitions so choppy that it detracted from the fun. I associated this more with the fuel injection than with the engine configuration, although obviously grunty twins are going to compound any such difficulty in the fuel delivery. I've never had this issue with carbureted engines, big v-twins included.<br><br>My only complaint with the SD is the extreme intensity of the on/off throttle transition when I'm dealing with a series of tight first (and occasionally second) gear corners. I will certainly be working on better throttle control, including trying to avoid ever being all the way off the throttle if possible -- I even look forward to the challenge. But I also would like to reduce this problem through whatever mechanical means might be available.<br><br>Again, thanks for all the input.

That would tame the hit somewhat, I'm sure, and deliver a wider ranger in each gear, like you mentioned.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Stratkat.svg" alt=Stratkat> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Stratkat</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-07 06:35:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Oh and please dont knock the TLs, I love mine, well sorted the TLs is better than the SD mid corner and on the exit and will suck the paint off any SD/SDR </span></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TLSRuss.svg" alt=TLS_Russ> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TLS_Russ</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-07 21:01:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TLSRuss.svg" alt=TLS_Russ> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TLS_Russ</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-08 00:18:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Scribe78.svg" alt=Scribe78> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Scribe78</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-08 00:21:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="about.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="terms.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
