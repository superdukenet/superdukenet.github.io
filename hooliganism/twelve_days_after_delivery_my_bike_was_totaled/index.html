I couldn't take delivery of it because the dealer made an error in assembly and reversed two connectors such that the bike wouldn't start. I took delivery of it on Monday, August 3rd. <br> <br>After riding it for a week, I realised something was wrong with the suspension. On August 7th, I pulled out the manual and checked the settings. Nothing was within spec. In fact, the left and right front shocks weren't even the same as each other. The bike had some weird wobbling tendencies when leaning right. All of the settings on that fork were set to full soft (or open). I set the bike up per the manual, however it still wobbled a little under braking. I chalked that up to one of two things: Either I needed to tinker with the suspension settings or I needed to install a steering damper. On Wednesday, August 12th, the phenomenon was worse, particularly at 70 MPH on the highway. it was very windy out and I thought that may have played into it. <br> <br>The morning of Thursday, August 14th, it was still funky and I thought I should call the dealership when I got to work. I never made it to work. I crested a hill and there was a stoplight at the bottom with cars stopped. I was traveling at ~30 MPH and had plenty of room to brake. I pulled the front lever and the bike began to slow. Then the front of the bike dived. It took me a split second to realise that I had just heard a tyre sliding. My front brake had locked up. <br> <br>There was no resistance from the front brake lever and I pumped it a few times to no avail. I was getting too close for comfort to a dump truck stopped in front of me and realised '<span style="font-style: italic">I've got to get off this thing'</span>. That was very easy because the front wheel wasn't turning. I leaned left because there was no traffic in that lane and there was a guardrail to my right. As soon as I leaned, the bike went down and I pushed myself away from it. It slid and I rolled away from the dump truck. When I stopped, I had slid beyond the back of the truck and found myself next to the driver's door. I stood up and walked to the back of his truck to find my bike under his low-hanging box steel bumper. <br> <br>I dragged the bike out and the driver helped me stand it up. We couldn't roll it because a front caliper was still seized so we lifted it up and carried it off the roadway. <br> <br>The police arrived and the driver said he saw the whole thing in his mirror. When he heard the tyre screech, he looked to see my fighting to keep the bike up and watched me lay it down. The police didn't issue me a citation, which they could have done for any number of reasons such as failure to maintain control of the vehicle or defective equipment. Two of the three officers who showed up were riders and they were just as shocked as me to see that the front wouldn't budge. The officers had to help the tow truck driver drag the bike onto the flatbed. <br> <br>The bike was towed to my house and still sits with the caliper seized. I've called my insurance company as well as KTM's corporate office. I explained to KTM my issues with the dealer's incompetence with respect to their failure to assemble the bike properly, set up the suspension within specs and failure to test-ride it before delivery. It had 0 miles on it and splash of fuel in the tank. He wants me to have the bike towed to the dealer so they can inspect it. That's not going to happen. <br> <br>I'm sure it's a total loss. Both front forks are damaged, the handle bar is broken, the headlamp and cluster assembly is hanging off, the left controls are broken, the clutch cover is banged up, the radiator is dented, the front panels are gouged, the left exhaust cover is damaged and the frame is damaged. <br> <br>I have a couple of strawberries on my left leg from the impact and I pulled a muscle in my calf, but I'm otherwise fine. Thank God for safety gear. It would be a completely different story if I went down with the bike and ended up under the dump truck. <br> <br>Does anyone have any thoughts as to what could have caused this on a new bike with a couple hundred miles on it?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/BASH69.svg" alt=BASH69> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">BASH69</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-08-16 19:24:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>A big question is what is causing the caliper to lock up? <br>If there is pressure in the line, it would be indicative of a problem in the master cylinder. A mis-adjusted lever could prevent the fluid in the line from dropping in pressure to release the brake. If this is not releasing correctly, it can drag the brake a little, causing a heat buildup in the caliper. This compounds itself, as the heat causes the fluid to expand a little, causing more break pressure. If the brake lever can not fully retract, the piston does not uncover the fluid return bore in the master, preventing the brake pressure to drop to zero. <br>The other possiblilty is a binding piston in the caliper. Kinda rare, but not unheard of. <br>The key to the mystery will be what happens if you crack open the bleeder fitting. If a shot of fluid squirts out and the brake releases, it's in the master. If nothing happens, it's in the caliper. <br>I only crack the bleeder with an impartial witness or dealer personnel present, as that would be proof possitive of the cause of the accident. <br>With no witness, it's only your word. We all know how that goes.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AvataR.svg" alt=AvataR> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AvataR</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-08-16 20:03:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/cjc.svg" alt=cjc> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">cjc</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-08-16 20:07:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/drswade.svg" alt=drswade> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">drswade</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-08-16 20:11:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/easze76.svg" alt=easze76> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">easze76</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-08-16 20:38:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AvataR.svg" alt=AvataR> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AvataR</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-08-16 21:55:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/onesiccsupduk.svg" alt=onesiccsupduk> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">onesiccsupduk</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-08-16 22:26:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>This definitely sounds like a not fit for purpose claim. <br> <br>The bike was never right, and shouldn't have been allowed on the road if it was behaving like you claim. <br> <br>Glad you're ok mate.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AvataR.svg" alt=AvataR> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AvataR</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-08-16 23:31:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>There are several threads on here about brake problems, but I think mostly with bikes in the UK that have been ridden through the winter. <br> <br>Here are some: <br> <br><a class=postlink href="http://www.superduke.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8141&amp;highlight=brakes+again">http://www.superduke.net/forum/viewtopi ... akes+again</a> <br> <br><a class=postlink href="http://www.superduke.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8138&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=brakes+again&amp;start=0">http://www.superduke.net/forum/viewtopi ... in&amp;start=0</a> <br> <br><a class=postlink href="http://www.superduke.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7630&amp;highlight=brakes+again">http://www.superduke.net/forum/viewtopi ... akes+again</a> <br> <br>I'm glad you are OK and hope you get it sorted out to your satisfaction.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/drswade.svg" alt=drswade> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">drswade</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-08-16 23:58:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I bought a SD on 23rd of December and rode it home. About a mile or less from the dealer, I tried to upshift and thought "wow, this has a REALLY long shifter stroke". Then I looked down and realised that the linkage had fallen off! Lurched into a restaurant and called the dealer. "While I am eating, YOU WILL send someone to fix or pick up the bike!" They did the right thing and came out with a linkage cannabilized from another SD on the floor.. Two days later I was trying to figure out the Multi-Function Display and looked for page 8 in the Owner's Manual. Problem was mine started at page 16!!! What pisses me off is that they had my money and the purchase was made a week prior. Plenty of time to suss out the bike, right? <br> As has been chronicled many times here, dealers as a rule SUCK! I wouldn't even let mine touch my bike if I hadn't made the first two services part of my conditions for purchase. I have purchased 15 new motos since 1986 and have never had this kind of issue. KTM makes a fantastic product and you have experienced an anomaly. These are machines and stuff does happen. How they deal with it (KTM, Inc.) is where the rubber meets the road, as they say. Thankfully you have had a very survivable crash. <br>Now let the vulture lawyers handle it. You are on the right track, I think. <br>Kinda hard to pony up for an RC8 when you have a problem like you are experiencing, huh? <br>Best of luck to you Brother!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AvataR.svg" alt=AvataR> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AvataR</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-08-17 00:10:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>a quick question but where do you live and who's the dealer?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/weeksy.svg" alt=weeksy> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">weeksy</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-08-17 00:25:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/weeksy.svg" alt=weeksy> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">weeksy</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-08-17 04:09:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/PigBenis.svg" alt="Pig Benis"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Pig Benis</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-08-17 15:00:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/roamer.svg" alt=roamer> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">roamer</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-08-17 15:38:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content><span style="font-style: italic">The fact that the brake lever has no resistance other than that of the return force is very scary. </span> <br> <br>Do you mean there is no pressure, the lever is floppoy? <br>If thats the case, I think you are dealing with a stuck master cylinder piston.
