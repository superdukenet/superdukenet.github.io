Shortly thereafter, we RSVP'd and asked to ride the new Superduke during the first, 10:00 AM slot. We received a confirming call this past week from the dealer. We were told 10:00 slot was full, but we could ride at 11:30. Both Omky and I had stuff planned for the afternoon, and 11:30 was cutting it close, but doable. So, we booked 11:30. I was pretty excited to try the TV4 back to back with the 1290 SDR. I thought I could do a decent right up of the strengths and weaknesses of each. But, . . ..<br><br>Today, we showed up promptly at 10:30 AM and went to the registration table to check in. There was no obvious check in desk at the local dealer's tent, so we went to the KTM corporate tent. There I met one of the most arrogant jackasses of my entire life - Mr Randy Mullinix, Area Sales Manager, Southwest region. We told Mr. Mullinix that we were signed up for the 11:30 time slot. He responded, our list or their list (indicating the local dealer's tent)? I said their list. He says, they shouldn't have done that. We tried using their list, but some people didn't show up, so we scrapped it and there is no list except our list. The first time slot available for the 1290 is 12:30 P.M. <br><br>Mind you, this was 10:30 and the demo rides started at 10:00. So, this brain trust took a shit on all his potential customer's schedules because he wasn't smart enough to fill empty spots with newcomers and leave the rest of the list in tact. No apologies. No nothing. He just tried to blame his own incompetence on the dealer - without whom we'd have never heard of the event. Because, to my knowledge, KTM made no effort to promote it.<br><br>That's it. I will never buy another KTM. Good job Randy. Way to promote that KTM good will. Shows us dumb asses what type of customer service we can expect when we shell out $20K for your product. But, unfortunately, I already knew that, having previously drunk the Koolaide. <br><br>I'm throwing my hat in as moderator. I will no longer do anything to promote this company in any way. Anyone who wants to take my spot, weekends, should contact me or one of the other mods for more info.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Aphex" alt=Aphex> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Aphex</h3> <time datetime="2014-09-28 01:39:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2014-09-28 01:39:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Have a good sleep on it.

The KTM rep I was talking to was the truck driver/organizer. Very nice guy, apparently good friends with Mike Brown (Brownie), drives the rig for all of the Supercross events here in the US. We had a nice chat about SX and he signed me up for the SD @ 10:00 on the spot.<br><br>The guy your talking about showed up just as I was completing the process and started barking out orders and imposing his authority on the situation.

Another echo of the arrogance exhibited by their regional sales guy.<br><br>Friday, I was offered the use of a 1290 for the afternoon at the track. Even though the trackday org is sponsored by KTM, ironically none of the org's on-site intro school instructors wanted to use it that day (they prefer the RC8Rs) ... I declined. Free gas, tyres - and it was the faster black version. Been there, done it - probably not gonna do it again. Dragging hard parts on a wallowing suspension - pass. Who knows, maybe in a couple of years, KTM will get the bike sorted. I doubt it however, and with little-to-no actual corporate customer support (reflective my own experiences), I probably won't care.<br><br>Still having fun on the 990 nearly every day (those when there's nothing to maintain/fix), and still like it's appearance (admittedly more than I like the 1290's lower, stretched look).<br><br>Sorry to learn you and Omky had such a shitty experience.
