Does it have auto-steering cruise control directionally managed by GPS and road-feature recognition technology, so all you have to do is sit there? <br><br>I had a somewhat analogous conversation with someone this morning, who has been riding nearly every day of his life for the last 50-odd years, about an article reviewing the Can-Am Spyder RS-S (there are now EIGHT models of "Spyder" BTW). Oh, and interestingly, the RS-S comes in ORANGE - LOL.<br><br>After all his years of riding (also the owner of more than one open-top sports car), he was remarkably excited about what the reviewers had to say - particularly that it was as close to riding a motorcycle, without actually doing so. <br><br>All I could ask was "... what's the point"? "You have motorcycles, which you ride all the time, and some open-top high-performance roadsters for those times when you want doors and roof - optional". <br><br>His response was simple - "Good points - it would be silly for me to own one ... but its not the same in a car, not having to wear a helmet ...". To which I responded: " ... you can always wear a helmet in your car if you wanted ...". We laughed at our mutual concerns of how the local constabulary would perceive that (negatively, of course). <br><br>The same question "... what's the point ..." comes to mind regarding this 1290 Super Adventure, with it's supposedly superlative mystery electronics (best guess: suspension) of "... the new 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE will feature further absolutely unique electronically supported riding assistance equipment." Who knows, maybe it's automatic pop-out wheels for when one comes to a stop. Or perhaps the seat has a built-in feature that wipes your ass for you. Will it have air bags (like Gold Wings) too?<br><br>At a certain point, it seems to me there's an experience value being lost here, where this bike is barely removed from being nothing more than a Jeep Wrangler missing a couple of (driven) wheels. LOL - even their pricing will be comparable.<br><br>While I'll never resign to forward controls or three-wheeler (I will stop riding before having to resort to either - sidecars possibly excepted), I can understand the elemental draw of the contemporary "cafe" bike rider, and even that of the H-D owner. Even H-D's full-baggers aren't this ridiculous with features - yet. <br><br>At what point are you no longer the operating rider; reduced to being a passenger contributing little more than some steering input? What happened to an engine, two wheels, and little else?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-08-22 00:04:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>They, the manufactures have gone far enough.

I have to admit that I really like the traction control on my 1290 Superduke R. It takes some skill development away but it is nice to just crank on the throttle out of a corner and not worry about highsiding.<br><br>Also I remember a video by a top rally rider comparing abs to non abs on an 1190 on dirt. ABS won every time.<br><br>I have yet to ride the 1190 but sat on one last year(demo rides got rained out). Too big and heavy for me. It would be great for sport touring duty and some light off road duty, but nothing more. The videos of people doing crazy things off road on big adventure bikes are fun to watch, but give me my light weight EXC 500 any time! Falling down on the EXC is almost a non event. Pick it up and off you go. Love that.<br><br>One bike only then maybe the 1190 is the ticket or the 1290 Super Adventure, but I prefer a really good road bike and a really good dirt bike.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/soarsore.svg" alt=soarsore> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">soarsore</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-08-27 04:44:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I had a 2014 1190 adventure R. I have had all kinds of bikes for the past 30 years, street and motocross stuff. I thought the adventure R would be awesome for on and off road and bought one. It was a awesome bike for street and riding dirt roads. For me it was way to big and heavy to have any real fun offroad. It sucked after riding a YZ 250. I also decided I was not going to trash a bike that expensive riding offroad. The 1290 Super Duke hit my dealers floor and I had to have it. I sold the adventure and bought the Duke. I love the Duke and do not miss the adventure. I felt kinda gay riding the adventure.

The 950 and 990 were hardly lightweight with those massive fuel tanks. I had a go on a 950 and just didn't have the skills to ride it off road. The m8 who owned it could ride that quicker on firetrails than I could my 450 EXC. 1290 does seem a little overkill but if people want them they will make them. <br><br>As for the electronics, I'm from the old school too. Lots of friends want the latest ZX10Rs for all the traction control. They think it might take a couple of seconds off their laptimes and it may well do. Personally I like my right wrist to be my traction control, there is skill in that but there is no escaping it. In 10 years every bike with any grunt will come with it but as long as there is an off switch I'll live with it.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Aphex.svg" alt=Aphex> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Aphex</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-08-28 07:16:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bigsur.svg" alt=big_sur> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">big_sur</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-08-28 07:34:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Had an 1190 ADV as a loaner today while they replaced the leaking engine cover.<br>When I did a test ride a while back I liked it, now not so much.<br>Compared to the 1290 SDR it feels heavy and wide.
