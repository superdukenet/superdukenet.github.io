<p><div class=content>yes it did but not because of any spill but because of broken terminal connector from the reg to the battery hence the non starting of the bike at the petrol station. <br> <br>bike is 8mths old and has 7500ks. was not through corrotion it just simply had enough and broke <br> <br>well the track day up till then was going great, 2nd quickest in the first session from 25 ridrs and 3rd in the second session from 19 riders but one of them was sergio gadea 125gp rider with wins under his belt and a mate of his on an r1 who was very quick altough i duid stay with him on every part except the straight for three laps and then my pegs were touching and the back en a bit lively, still on the standard tyres and didnt fancy picking my bike up because of anything stupid. the gp rider was on a cbr600 track bike and lapped 4-5 seconds a lap quicker than me and that orange thing that kept going arround the outside of most that were there. <br> <br>anyway weather was good around 18 degrees when we first hit the circuit, first 3 laps warmong everything up but most important getting my head into gear after a long night drinking <br>had some slippy moments from the back when things got going but not too bad, i take a while to get warmed up but when i was warmed up me and the duke started hunting the ones that had flown past on the first lap and that had not nearly crashed because of cold tyres <br> <br>caught a group of three, sp1, rsv, sp2, ha ha on the long left that takes you onto the straight we went around the outside of all three and on the shitty bit of track and then nice and smooth onto the straight we had gained just enough to keep them at bay until the next quick cormer, down three gears form 6th tad on the brakes exiting with 7thou on the taco close to the piano open her up untill 9500 then into 4th for a few seconds before going down two for the corner where rossi crashed and lost the title to hayden, round there and as soon as shes off max lean a nice dossing of gas and up to 3rd, 4th then back down to 3rd for the right hander and knee on the deck and the piano and off we go for the left hander thats nasty as its slightly off camber and lots loose the front going in. the opertunity to glance behind confirms that the relative silence means im on my own to enjoy he sound of my motor and leos as they both sing in harmoy as we engine brake and exit with full on gas <br> <br>after the left hander where the peg is touching down we find the straight were i spy an r1 coming from the pits and for the rest of the first session we paly around until the stright where he does go away but was holding back obviously as sometimes we managed to stay in his slipstream until the corners began, trouble on the straight we could only mamge 215-220 kph, 16-40 gearing but anyway he was kind and we had a good time for the last few laps, though i did have the back moving around atad too much for the level we were at. t <br> <br>the second session was even better but that i will keep for another day. <br> <br> <br>so my conclusion was that the terminal should not break so check them for signs, because of this the battery on the move was not charging and hence when we wanted to go again she said no. battery is now hooked up, terminals replaced and another conextion added for security and all should be good. </div></p> </div> <div
