Without my buddy there to get me out of the shite a couple of times I would have been stuck. This is what I want to try and avoid with this one.

Going to make it into a PDF. If anyone can think of a step I've missed let me know and I'll add it. Missing a couple of pics which I will source. <br><br><br><br> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I’m going to try and walk through base and head gasket change with timing chains replacement on the 990 LC8 engine. Mine is in a Superduke 06 with 50220 fairly hard miles on the clock. Mods are heads ported and polished at 42k miles, Motobox and full titanium Akra system. <br><br>Reason for doing this is the basegaskets are leaking (again) so I’m going to use some Wellseal this time after cleaning everything up and over torque the heads down to 44nm instead of 38. If they leak again she’s in the bin! While in there it was recommended to change the timing chains. Not something I’ve ever attempted before on any engine so pretty scary for me. I am using a walkthrough from <a class=postlink href="http://www.ktm.950info">http://www.ktm.950info</a> called Camchain R&amp;R <a class=postlink href="http://ktm950.info/how/Orange%20Garage/Engine/Cam/camchain/uk_mouse_chain_replacement/uk_mouse_camchain.html">http://ktm950.info/how/Orange%20Garage/ ... chain.html</a> but it’s on a 950 and some parts have changed since then. Also not as in depth that a noob like me could use it on my own. I did the work at a m8s workshop. He owns a 950 Adv and has changed his timing chains so knows the engine and can help me out when I venture into the unknown. Also has a bike bench and a few tools I don’t own yet that will be required. <br><br>Here she is looking a bit sorry for herself. Oil leaking for both base gaskets and recently been raced so covered in it. Crap everywhere. Hopefully looking better soon. <br> <br><br><br><br><br>Get everything off the bike . Disconnected the oil tank by removing pipe below the feed valve so didn’t lose any oil out of the tank. It’s only 2 trackdays and a 1.5 hour race old so a bit more in it yet. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Plan orignally was to take the engine out and work on the bench but decided to leave the engine in the frame and pivot it forward at the lowest engine bolt. Having it in the frame give me something to lever against with some of the larger torqued nuts. <br><br><br><br><br>All the bits required to do the job. <br><br><br><br>Head and base gaskets<br><br><br><br>Gudgeon pin retaining clips<br><br><br><br>Timing chains<br><br><br><br>So into it. Remove the speak plugs so you can turn the engine over by hand. You do this by removing the plug in the centre of the ignition casing and using a large hex/ allen socket and tuning anticlockwise. We want to get TDC for front cylinder first and remove the cams. It’s the rear cylinder coming off first and rear timing chain being removed first but you need the front cams out to be able to remove the rear timing chain. I’ll expain why when I get to that point. I only know this as I didn’t remove the cams and ran into this problem. Ended up having to remove the front cam bridge when the piston was not at TDC. Valves were partially open so there was pressure on the bridge from cams. Took 10 mins are undoing bolts half a turn each cross ways across the bridge to avoid breaking it. You don’t want to break the cam bridge! It’s machined and matched at manufacture with the head. Breaking it will prove very expensive! <br><br><br><br>Front cylinder at TDC. Dots lined up and lobes facing outwards. Remove the bridge and the cams. I’m missing this pic as I didn’t remove them at this point. <br><br>(pic required!!!)<br><br>Remove the rear cam cover and keep turning the engine anticlockwise until the 2 dots line up to show the rear at TDC. Lobes face in and lock the engine with the engine locking bolt inserted in clutch side. You might want to check valve clearances at this point. I did mine a month ago so didn’t do them again. <br><br><br><br><br><br>Engine locking bolt<br><br><br><br>Remove the cam bridge and lift out the cams. Now remove the cam chain tensioner. Remove the plug and then I use a magnet to slide the actual tensioner out. If it comes out in 2 bits its fooked and will have to be replaced. Mine were replaced 8k miles ago and are thankfully fine. <br><br><br><br><br><br>Next remove the double timing gear needle bearing bolt. <br><br><br><br>With a hooked piece of wire or similar lift the timing chain over the double gear and it will sit on a small shelf on the inside and remove the gear.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Now you have access to the 2 internal cylinder bolts. Remove the nuts. Be careful as you really down’t want to drop one of these down the timing chain channel and into the guts of the engine. Everything has a coating of oil and so is slippy. I use a magnet again. There is also a washer under the nut so don’t forget about that. It may come out with nut or you can remove it once you have the cylinder off the bike. Also remove the 2 external nuts. <br><br><br><br>Now remove the chain guide. 8mm bolt and the outide and lift the guide out through the top. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>At this point I put the cams back in and secured with a 4 bolts into the bridge. This is to stop the shim buckets falling out later. I’m not having the valves out so no need to remove the buckets. One less thing to have to put back and mixing up th ebuckets and shims is exactly the kind of thing I’d do. <br><br><br>The cylinder can be lifted up. A wobble from side to side breaks the gasket seal and gently lift the cylinder until the top of the con rod becomes visable. You want to leave the piston in the cylinder for now. If you want to inspect and measure ring gaps you can do this later. You will see the gudgeon pin come into view. You remove it from the opposite side to the timing chain. You can see the rings so don’t go any further or they will pop out. I fill the open engine with clean rags so you can’t drop anything in there. The clip holding the gudgeon pin in will love nothing more than to fly out as you remove it and drop into the guts of the engine. This could be bad. With the clip removed you can just ease the pin out by using your finger from the oppostite side. With the pin out the cylinder will just lift off. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>You can see here the marks in the engine casings that is not helping with oil leaks. I’m going to use very fine wet and dry and WD40 to remove as much of these as possible. They aren’t deep and I’m only using very gentle pressure. Remove the cylinder bolts and dowle pins and starter motor to make this easier. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="http://s270.photobucket.com/user/Colonel_Klinck/media/Timing%20chains%20clutch%20side/DSCN2467_zps0e56aab8.jpg" alt=Image><br><br>Nothing now in the way so removing marks in engine casing and cleaning it up. <br><br><br><br><br><br>Now take the head and and bore apart. They are held together with 3 allen bolts. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>These were cleaned up 8k miles ago when I had heads ported and polished. Some carbon build up. I won’t be removing it as it can only help with compression huh <br><br>Now a small gear puller to remove the gear.<br><br><br><br>Ok that’s everyting done for the rear cylinder. Time to move onto the front. <br><br>Unlock the engine again and turn it anticlockwise through 360 + 70 degrees and it’s at TDC for the front. You can see through the hole from the locking bolt a small indent in the when the bike is at TDC. Look for this if you are unsure. Although it’s not critical as the engine is rebuilt from the rear cylinder and there are marking to show when you are at this. <br><br>Follow the steps for rear cylinder to remove the front. Cam chain tensioner, double timing gear, chain guide and then lift cylinder, remove gudgeon pin and slide off cylinder and strip and clean. Front cylinder had more pronaunced honing still visable<br><br><br><br>Remove the ignition cover. You’ll need to remove the fly wheel. I didn’t have a fly wheel puller so used a 20mm thread bolt and an impact gun and it comes straight off. Then remove the freewheel behind it<br><br><br><br>Next remove the idler gear on the end of the balancer shaft. <br><br><br><br>You can use a rubber mallet to tap the balancer shaft through from the clutch side. Once it’s out you can swap the timing chains and place it back in. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Back on with the idle gear and freewheel gear and finally the flywheel. This needs to be torqued up to 150nm. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Ok that’s the ignition side complete. You need to unlock the engine and turn it anticlockwise to rear TDC and past it to get timing back to where you had it when gears were removed. You can see its there by lining up the ignition sensor and gear that was photographed when the engine was advanced to let the gears come off.<br><br><br><br>Lock the engine again and fit the new timing chain and its gear. Tap the woodruff pins back in.<br><br><br><br>Refit the balancer weight. Its keyed so you can’t get it wrong. Tap in with a socket<br><br><br><br>Then the first of the 2 gears, again this is keyed to the Woodruff key so you can’t go wrong. <br><br><br><br>Next is the outer gear. Its important you line this up proberly with the first geat or the weight will be in the wrong place and engine will be unblanced. Use the tipex marks to get the correct position. <br><br><br><br><br><br>Getting the spring loaded clip back in position is a bitch. You need to line it up with the outer gear and then put it in place. Add the washers in the correct order and then the nut with 243 and tighten to the point you can still just move the clip with circlip pliers. I found it needed the help of a screw driver pushing it into correct position to get it home. Tighten nut to 120nm.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You can now safetly unlock the engine and turn it back a few degrees to TDC on the gears. Lock it off again and its time to rebuild the rear cylinder. You can refit the starter motor at this point as well. <br><br>Rebuilding the rear is simply a reverse of the strip. Refit the studs to bolt the cylinder/head down and the dowl pins. Bolt the head back to the cylinder with a new gasket. I then used the wellseal on the engine casing and placed gasket in place. Lower the cylinder down,feed the cam chain lower guide into the channel and feed the conrod into the piston. Slide in the gudgeon pin. Now comes the bitch. Getting the retaining pin or as I named it the Jesus fooking Christ! pin as it flew across the workshop for the 3rd time. I warn you it’s a biatch! Keep those rags in the engine casing or you can bet the thing will fly in there and then you are going to have to try and retrieve it. When it is finally in place lower the head all the way down. Refit the main nuts and tighten in 2 stages. First to 20nm and then to 38. I went to 45 as those bitches ain’t leaking again!! I then poured 1ltr of oil down the timing chain channel. Its around what was lost when I removed the sump plug. Refit the upper chain guide. Next comes the double timing gear and its needle bearing bolt to 30nm. Cam chain adjuster next and tighten to 20nm. Finally the cams go back in in the correct postions . Bolt down the bridge. Tighten larger bolts and smaller to 10nm and then the larger bolts to 18nm. You can fit the cam cover and move on to the front cylinder. Unlock the engine bolt and turn the engine anti clockwise 360 + 70 degrees. Lock it off and fit the cylinder following same procdure for rear. <br>With that done you can unlock the engine and refit the ignition and clutch side engine covers. If you want to play it safe, before you fit the spark plugs you can turn the engine over by hand to make sure nothing fouls. If you have followed all the steps and taken your time it should be fine. Better to be safe than sorry though. If its all good fit the plugs.<br><br>Then its just a matter of fitting everything back on the bike.

Look for the Orange Crush section.<br><br>I have a suggestion for engine rebuilds like this. If you look in the service manual you will see an engine stand which is easy to fab if you have the means. It supports the engine and the frame can be removed with ease. I replaced my bent frame with an engine stand I made. I was able to keep the FI bodies and all the wiring in place and pivoted the frame off myself.
