I've been an avid follower since signing on shortly after buying my new shiny superduke in April last year. However, last night some s---tbag stole it. I had it parked in the Valley, at the corner of Barry Pde and Gotha St, in one of the city fringe motorcycle parking areas as you can't park on the sidewalk in view from the restaurant/bar in Brisbane. And just as my wife and I walked back to the parking area, it appeared from the shadows on the other side of the road being ridden (poorly) by an Rshole, and that is likely the last I will see of it.<br><br>The main reason I'm posting though, is that while I was talking to the quite friendly, but not ultimately very useful coppers, they had another KTM (don't know which model) reported stolen from a bike park in Brisbane as well. Someone is building a nice collection.<br><br>The culprits left behind a previously stolen damaged triumph daytona (with no ignition) at both locations. The cops say that there is currently a task force working on bike theft which is apparently rampant in Bne at the moment. 5 bikes stolen yesterday alone. Some is organised chop shop stuff, some is just as trades for drugs, while part of it is just joyrides till they find something worth cashing in for drugs (which a superduke definitely is).<br><br>I have comprehensive insurance, including what should be full replacement should mine not turn up in decent condition, and while there are bugger all superdukes left in stores in Oz, and they are phasing the model out before bringing out the 1290 next year, I did manage to find one at Team Moto Virginia, who were nice enough to accept a deposit on the 2013 model, contingent on the insurance payout being approved next week. So there is a silver lining.<br><br>Incidentally, the dealers said they were at a KTM dealers conference last night, where the KTM rep stated that the 1290 won't be the same kind of bike as the 990. Much heavier and less nimble as a result apparently. Designed more with competing with the latest japanese/bmw fours in a straight line than in the twisties.<br><br>So in any case, if you're planning to visit Brisbane or the valley, keep a good eye on your bike, or take the train.<br><br>Sean</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/jmann.svg" alt=jmann> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">jmann</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2013-05-22 05:55:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Wasitlooklike?

For now, I'm awaiting a call from their third party investigators, today or tomorrow, who will report back to QBE, after which they will be in a position to settle the claim. They didn't mention how long they wanted to wait to see when it turns up. My thinking is that someone who's gone to the trouble to steal a pretty well brand new superduke isn't just going to dump it when it runs out of fuel, so it'll either turn up trashed after being dropped, or in a year or so when some drug house gets raided (happened just last year to a mate's vespa, which was not in good nick to say the least).<br>Thanks for the support guys.<br><br>Sean</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Sean.svg" alt=Sean> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Sean</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2013-05-22 07:57:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content><img src="http://i1351.photobucket.com/albums/p784/Sean2101/IMG_1323_zps1965ab4b.jpg" alt=Image><br><br>Here she is, while I was waiting for the Akras to arrive last year.<br><br>Sean</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ktmguy.svg" alt=ktmguy> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">ktmguy</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2013-05-22 08:24:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Sad.. <br>Hope they kill themselves on it... bunch of cnuts! </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Sean.svg" alt=Sean> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Sean</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2013-05-22 08:30:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>my thoughts too.<br><br>I've found myself thinking that the SE Asian punishment for theft of taking off one hand would make it really hard to steal another superduke.

It does have a magnetically coded key and immobiliser I presume. I've got the code card here at home. The bastard took it across the road into the dark to work on for a while. Must have punched the ignition through like on the dumped triumph, which would have taken care of the steering lock. And they must have worked out a way around our immobilisers, as some other bloke had his KTM stolen on the same day (with a previously stolen trumpy left next to it).<br><br>He had a full backpack which could have fit a laptop in I suppose.<br><br>The detectives who turned up reckon that bikes pretty much disappear within hours. He wouldn't tell me where I could go and pick up a cheap bike, but obviously they exist somewhere.<br><br>I WISH I'd have had a tracker on it that I could have told the cops to log on to when they arrived, although the bike did get a good 40 minute head start, which was a bit irritating, since we were literally two blocks from the cop shop. </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/kevxtx.svg" alt=kevxtx> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">kevxtx</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2013-05-22 11:46:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Damn annoying, they better leave my bike alone I work &amp; park just down the road from where yours was parked.

If it wasn't for the lack of other distinguishing features, I wouldn't have bloody mentioned the reflectors!<br><br>So having put a bit of thought into it, here's my take on how it was done.<br><br>The clue is in the dumped Trumpies. As far as I know, the TuneECU cables for KTM's and Trumpies are identical, which leads me to believe the ECU system software and hardware are also very similar.<br><br>So, punch the ignition out, taking care of the steering lock. Wheel it away to somewhere sheltered and hidden (only across the bloody street behind a 4wd in this case!). Attach a temporary switch into required iginition wiring. Pop the seat lock, and plug in TuneECU, or slightly modded TuneECU version, and use this to disable alarms related to ignition voltages, and immobiliser, and whatever else is required. Put seat back on. Flick switch and ride away with someone elses baby. Prick.<br><br>I'd have thought the same thing about the rarity of late model Superdukes in Oz, but shit, maybe it's not even staying here. The cops didn't think that bike rarity was going to be a help at all.

How does it handle in comparison to a Superduke. I'm a big fan of supermoto bikes (having grown up on a farm on dirt bikes), but I can't see me having the kahunas to throw that thing sideways on Brisbane roads! Having said that though, the superduke was incredibly smooth and confidence inspiring every time the rear broke free while cranked over, so who knows?<br><br>I fear I may have inadvertently set you up for a bit of a ribbing about the reflectors though.

He's currently interviewing my wife, and will call our mates to get some alibis to verify my whereabouts, and then he says his report should be finalised by Tuesday/Wednesday (after it's been checked and signed off). He can't comment on how the insurer (QBE) will behave after that, but once the report is finalised, it's only a matter of them deciding how to settle the claim, so hopefully I might have an outcome by the end of next week.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DavoSingapore.svg" alt=Davo-Singapore> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Davo-Singapore</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2013-05-25 21:19:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Sorry Buddy.
