Hit the start button and headed back to the pits,( bike was stuck in 3rd gear due to bent shifter).<br><br>Once back in the Pits we checked the bike over, paint off the left side of swing arm, radiator shroud scratched up,<br>Ripped grip, bent clutch lever, that was it, so we bent everything back into shape as best as we could and went out <br>In the next session.<br><br>I have been trying to work out why this happened,as always with a "off" there was no warning, I took the corner as I always have many times before, although I was carrying a little more speed as I had just passed another rider.<br><br>The key difference may be is that I noticed when on track I had the bike set in super motard mode, this was a error on my part as I was late getting to the line for the start of the session and was fumbling through the modes and selected the wrong one, could this have caused the traction control to not be activated, I have asked many people and have got two different answers, some have told me that traction control does not turn off in super motard mode, and others say it does, ( which would explain the accident), can some one please clarify, Thanks.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Motogoon" alt=Motogoon> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Motogoon</h3> <time datetime="2016-01-16 18:29:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2016-01-16 18:29:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>The way you described the crash as no warning, suddenly down does not sound like a traction control crash, it sounds like you lost the front end.

It's a pisser when you crash and cannot equate how in the hell it happened. I have watched many a race from PI and I am amazed at what riders can get away with over that rise. When the bike lost and you lost it were you through the turn and headed back toward the track or were you pretty much straight off the track? Like many I think you lost the front. Do you recall the two tenths of a second before and did you feel like something was different. I'm sure that you have had the rear step out and after thought that it wasn't so bad and I'm sure that you have had the front wash out and with a bit of correction in a timely manner you thought that wasn't so bad either. When the front leaves you at speed when your pretty leaned over you could have little chance of feeling anything in time. I'm not talking about the crashes where the front washes out while still fairly upright and you get slammed to the tarmac. I'll bet that front end gets really light over that crest and just a bit more speed like you said is a recipe for disaster. You got back on that horse right away, we are all real proud of you If you do not come up with a solution blame the tyres and never use that brand again.</div> </div> </article> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
