I'm running a similar setup to GoGo and to be honest, it has been a real stuggle to make the geometry work.<br>One of the things he did was run the wheel as far back as possible to stop the wheelies, I tried the same but the bike never felt comfortabe.<br>After chatting with Viking, I thought I'd give the shorter wheelbase idea a go... Another benifit being that it lowered rear ride height without changing the swingarm angle.<br><br>To be plain... Awesome! I'm not quite as short as Viking as I don't want to make massive changes and our bikes are totally different as our riding styles.<br>I was leading a few laps against Cbr1000s and a GSXR1000 that turned out to be Shaun Giles' ex Aussie Superbike... 190hp!!!<br>They got past me in the second race and I had two false neutrals on the back straight, I'm kicking myself. I've already made a phonecall to get the bike looked at to try and develop a type of cam for the shift mechanism to shorten the throw.<br>My tyre warmer crapped itself and I was able to get on from the Suzuki rider, in the last race of the day, I was able to do consistant 49s with one 48 only 1 second off the lap record!<br>Our tracks are that small that a second is still a long way, but I felt like I could go even faster, but I had not got used to running a higher pace.<br><br>In summary, two 2nd's and a 3rd aint too bad at all <br><br>I only made 3 rounds and came second in the championship, but I'm really trying to race the I4s as the other guys in TB are not as fast, I race at the faster track in two weeks and I've had no saddle or setup time there, but there will be another 3 SD's so I hope to be able to keep up with them.<br><br>Here are the vids, and any comments or feedback on lines, style or such is always appreciated.<br><br><br></div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=DucatiPete" alt="Ducati Pete"> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Ducati Pete</h3> <time datetime="2012-10-07 21:58:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-10-07 21:58:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content></div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=TLSRuss" alt=TLS_Russ> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">TLS_Russ</h3> <time datetime="2012-10-08 04:40:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-10-08 04:40:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Love that Big Sky.......

Too jerky on my phone. <br><br>Glad it working out. <br><br>There's a few other things you can use to help things if your looking down this kinda route. Like you can more rear sag to get the swingarm moving better. Now the axle is further up the arm it makes it harder for it to push the shock up when you hit a bump. Taking a wee bit preload off will bring you even more side grip! And I had to change rebound on shock a fair bit to stop it lifting the rear off the ground so much in the braking zones. <br><br>If any guys are reading this with standard bike, don't just go out and lop a link off the chain..... especially on an 05/06. <br>The 07&gt; geo combined with the Nichols moves the front wheel further from the bike which allows this stuff to work. Shortening the wheelbase on a base bike will turn it into a minimoto. These bikes are race bikes only and i dunno about lingas but mine feels terrible until your on pace with it. <br><br>The wheelbase is actually as near as dammit standard. By doing this stuff It's the weight distribution that's alot different.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Linga" alt=Linga> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Linga</h3> <time datetime="2012-10-08 11:52:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-10-08 11:52:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Cheers matie, I'll give the rebound a go as I was lifting the rear on hard breaking.<br>Mine's even more nose down being SDR with 190/69's on, even with the forks all the way through I'm 14mm higher than stock in the rear!<br>I run a lot of comp and pre load at the moment to stop it diving as much and not using all the fork travel to stop the front tucking...

There's no way it should be tucking the front. It sounds like you've maybe got a band aid there to try and mask a handling issue. If you think about it the point in the 190 rear is to give you more side grip and exit drive. But it's costing you in entry coz you can't get it in hard , then coz apex speed will be lower you having to drive it harder from a lower speed which loads the tyres. <br><br>I'll give you a shout when I get time and we can bounce ideas about.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=TLSRuss" alt=TLS_Russ> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">TLS_Russ</h3> <time datetime="2012-10-09 10:06:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-10-09 10:06:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Linga's bike is an SDR so it has the steeper head angle like the 05/06 SD,but from the frame head angle not the yokes as with the 05/06SD,<br>thats going to need a different set up to cure the front tucking problem, I suspect the 190 rear is not helping at all,<br>You can check the head angle the bike is running as it is set up with an inclinometer, they are not expensive and will tell you straight away if you have gone too far, I have a Digi-pas one cost about 40 quid </div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Linga" alt=Linga> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Linga</h3> <time datetime="2012-10-09 21:15:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-10-09 21:15:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>great going linga, looks to me like you are tipping into the corner a little early sometimes and like I said to you the other weak about mine it looks like your bike is also runing wide out of the chicane, looks like your still getting headshake I can see from the shadow you are running some sort of screen, I have the tall touring one on my road headlight mask it will shake its head when hard on the power but not with the race mask on and no screen, wish I could be as smooth</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Linga" alt=Linga> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Linga</h3> <time datetime="2012-10-09 22:27:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-10-09 22:27:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Cheers TLSRuss, I have meant to do that but life keeps getting in the way!<br>I know the bike is nose down and am slowly adjusting things to lessen the fact, I had to buy a few tyres to get a good deal, so this year is a michelin year. <br>I'm basically spending every last bit of cash on it... Drags to improve the starts which increases oil consumption. Modifying whatever I can to make it lighter and Dynos here are $400 a pop. At this rate it would work out cheaper to buy my own Dyno!<br><br>You're right on the tipping in too early Cheesie, I get excited sometimes and don't wait and this, more than anything, is contributing to the front wheel issue. When I get it right, this bike turns frighteningly fast and to be honest I'm still getting used to it as I haven't had any saddle time. <br>That chicane is a funny one, as I'm down on power, this is the spot I get passed, so instead of the best line I break almost straight at it and don't get of them till the change of direction. This isn't the fastest way but it is the most defensive and because the bike is so loud I'm doing it every lap!<br><br>The head shakes are now gone thanks to Silverback's damper, I ran it for the first time 8 clicks from hard and will soften it up more I think. Collie is a very bumpy track so the bike wobbles a to anyway. <br><br>The screen is a new addition and is mainly for the faster track we have here. But I ran it to test it out and really like it. Even on Collie, it helped to get out of the wind a little. Not sure if it helps the bike but it calms me down and gives me time to relax and refocus. It is really good at the drags.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Viking" alt=Viking> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Viking</h3> <time datetime="2012-10-10 20:08:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-10-10 20:08:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>out of interest what sag front and rear what length is the back shock at or threads showing and what tyre presures, I am curently running the nichols with 5mm of fork leg above the top yolk thye shock standard length, static at the rear is 5-6mm and 33 loaded and have no problems with front end tuck but believe I need a little more rear ride height or damping as it has a tendency to run wide out of chicanes</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Viking" alt=Viking> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Viking</h3> <time datetime="2012-10-11 06:42:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-10-11 06:42:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Linga" alt=Linga> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Linga</h3> <time datetime="2012-10-11 09:35:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2012-10-11 09:35:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Relaxing and not putting pressure on the bars will help too.
