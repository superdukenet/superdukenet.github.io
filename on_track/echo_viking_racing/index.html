Big respect to him, because having got to know Viking there is no way that he would have asked for this kind of support himself. TLS made this happen, he started you and me thinking and inspired the notion.<br><br>I, personally was inspired by the reactions of this forum to offer help, both financial and practical, to contribute to his potential success. It got me really thinking. Reading his posts, and your offers of help, I started to imagine what it would be like being a sponsor and what it would mean. My company is a branding company and, without boring you all with the details, we love a challenge and we love the idea of bringing together eclectic mixes of talented people and helping them achieve their ambitions and goals. It's how I built my company, it's why we are successful and it's a philosophy that we try and apply every where we see the opportunity.<br><br>It's been a two week mission for me. To go from an initial thought, a daydream, to pitching to a company board to part with a significant sum of money out of profits to support something as random as a bike racer is not easy to do. <br><br>But we did it! <br><br>Today at 3 pm I pitched the idea to the Echo board. Probably at the same time as Viking, Klinky, Shade, Millar and another 15 forum members were hooning around Caddders at the SD Crashfest, (what, no crashes guys!!!),<br><br>I was in a board room with more butterflies in my stomach than I've had in the last twenty years of presenting jobs to big clients! <br><br>What you guys have to understand is that my co directors, like most people, are not that immediately fired up by bikes and bike racing. They know I'm into bikes but so what. If I just asked for a load of cash to sponsor a bike racer that'd have turned me down flat. If I said I wanted to do this because I loved bikes and it was something I was passionate about they'd have laughed me out of the room. I had to think of another angle.<br><br>I put together an argument that told them what we would get out of it. The opportunities to apply our branding skills to the job. The opportunities to train our design team. The morale boosting and team building that it would bring. The PR opportunities to present our company in a different way that is probably unique in the design business. I mean, I don't know of anyone in my position ever doing anything like this before.<br><br>It sort of scares the shit out of me. Don't know what we're getting ourselves into. <br><br>But anyway, they said yes and two weeks of holding back on getting excited and talking to vIking and trying to keep expectations low was finally released today. They said yes.<br><br>I was half way home tonight, could't get hold of Viking as he had packed up and was already on his way home from Cadwell, we'd missed each others phone calls because I was on a train with no reception and Amy was on at me to get back and help put the twins to bed. Stopped in a field by the side of the road and went out into the middle of it and cracked a bottle wine open. ( yes, I always carry one around with me!)<br><br>So really, the story is about Viking. And the guy I finally got on the phone to from the middle of a field in Sussex this evening. I probably bored the shit out of him with my half drunken ranting and excitement but then he was so excited as well about what it meant to him. We both have a lot to gain out of this I'm sure.<br><br>I 've learned a lot about this guy over the last few weeks. What I've learned is between me and him but I can tell you this is a guy who is driven and passionate with a lot of integrity. He's got a natural talent for motors sports and he'll probably succeed at everything he attempts. <br><br>If this forum is supporting him, in any way they can, then we'll all have a lot of fun following his adventure. Financial backing is always the hardest bit to get. It's a shit. But this bit is now sorted.<br><br>So any practical help we can give him will do more to actually increase his chance of success. There's been a lot of offers of help on this forum, let's not make them empty promises. I know how easy it is to offer help but it's another thing to actually turn up in the day and actually do it.<br><br>Wouldn't it be fooking amazing if we could all contribute to getting a Superduke on the rostrum against all those Japanese 4's. Viking has a proven track record of getting underpowered, out classed machines in the top so bring it on!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/omky756.svg" alt=omky756> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">omky756</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-17 23:44:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Cheers to you Bic..!!!<br>That's a BIG deal...and it took a lot of thought to get it done...<br>Makes me proud too...Even if you guys are across the pond..I'd though<br>of putting in for a silly minded "Well...if I only had plane fair" I'd meet up <br>to help out at the track... </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Linga.svg" alt=Linga> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Linga</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-18 00:01:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Well done Bic and good luck Viking!<br>Hope it all comes together for you mate, looks really good as the cash is the hardest part!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Jermo.svg" alt=Jermo> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Jermo</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-18 00:03:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>That's great news! <br><br>Will this mean Viking gets a great new sticker design every race and his bike (and vids) will be shown at your companies presentations?<br><br><br>Please let me know when the races are broadcasted so I can check them through mypremium.tv</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SDNerd.svg" alt=SDNerd> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SDNerd</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-18 00:07:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Wait a minute - was this money simply taken out of the "Hookers and Blow" budget, or what?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/omky756.svg" alt=omky756> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">omky756</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-18 00:19:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Crotchrockety.svg" alt=Crotchrockety> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Crotchrockety</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-18 01:31:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Awesome!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TLSRuss.svg" alt=TLS_Russ> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TLS_Russ</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-18 03:40:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Good morning Father John, my name is Bic Bicknell.

Up until last night I was Just thinking I can use my bike, take it to work and let the design team work out all the best surfaces to use and draw up the templates onto which they can work.<br><br>But it just dawned on me that Viking's bike is an '06 model so everything is a different shape. <br><br>Does anyone out there have an ACCURATE set of guides or specifications for the early model Superduke that they could get over to me this week? We need the talk fairings, left and right, front mudguard, nose cone, belly pan, tail panels and single seat hump. We also would like to have the templates for the rest of the tank if possible. Know that some areas are covered in stomp grip but it's good to know anyway.<br><br>I seen to remember that miller might have all this info. Not sure.<br><br>We also need to know a top quality supplier to produce the vinyl panels QUICKLY. Better if they were London area but not essential. Anyone know?<br><br>Viking, I'm presuming you are still on dual seat and tail hump as in your photos? Not converted to an SDR single seat yet have you? Tell me if you have. <br><br>No idea yet how we get them onto your bike. We could DHL them up to you if we get the luxury of finishing them early, at worst we send someone out to Rockingham on race day and stick em on during your warm up lap!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-18 06:18:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>L R Designs were fantastic and have the battle decals on file...<br><a class=postlink href="http://www.lr-designs.co.uk/">http://www.lr-designs.co.uk/</a></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/skip.svg" alt=skip> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">skip</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-18 06:27:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Well done Bic, awesome effort! <br><br>I'll PM you Ben Millar's number, I'm sure he has the full layout for 06 panels.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/samba.svg" alt=samba> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">samba</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-18 06:56:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Excellent news, well done Bic it couldnt of been easy convincing the company, well done to Russ as well for the initial suggestion!!!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/samba.svg" alt=samba> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">samba</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-18 07:36:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>crackin' stuff!!

Stop for a minute. Step back and rub your eyes, throw some water over yourself and take a good look. Forget it's an internet forum. Really open your eyes and absorb what is happening here. Can you actually believe this is happening? <br><br>Lets have a look at this. This is how utterly mad this is.<br><br><br>On the left we have A.<br><br>A= A 35 year old mechanic from Falkirk who is a bit obsessive, posts his confused ranty waffle on a Superduke website, decides as a crutch to cope with a family bereavement to race his old SD. <br><br>One the right we have B.<br><br>B= A huge UK major branding and marketing firm with no history and no interest in bike racing. <br><br>How the hell can these two completely different things possibly come together?<br>Through two men...........Russ and Bic...........this has happened. How many "chance" crossroads have come together at the exact right time to get here. <br>I say this alot....but humans overuse powerfull words so it devalues them. I cant even express what i think and feel just now. This happening is the combination of probably 20 "chances". One moment where there may be 10% of it heading this way and 90% going the normal way. These 10% chances have happened over and over lots of times over lots of situations and decisions and added up to get to this point. I mean come on. There is honestly more chance of winning the lottery than this happening. <br><br>I knew Bic was going into the meeting to pitch it to his partners. It was so bizzare i was fobbing it off a bit in my head. Up till now it's all just words typed on a forum or email. I had a crazy Cadwell trackday with ups and downs. Driving home and finally got a call from Bic. I dont know this guy. He's in a field in Surrey on is pushbike drinking a botte of wine. I'm sitting in a service station carpark somewhere near Doncaster heading home stinking of sweat and totally shattered.<br>I can hardly remember the phone call. It was like i was watching it on tv or something. <br><br>The main thing thats come out this is Bic and his company seem to be sponsoring me. As in, me for who i am and the journey i'm on. He doesn't expect me to win. He just wants me to keep being me and doing what i'm doing. It's really confusing coz he sees something i dont really see and dont know i'm doing.<br><br>You cant please everyone. I get there are guys out there who think i'm a dick. Totally accept that, all fine. Love it, hate it, dont care, not interested, supportive, negative......whatever. I dont have many good traits. All i am though is honest and and true. I am who i am and wont change. Get onboard and walk the path with us or dont. It's happening no matter what. Nobody, even Bic and me, has any idea where this road is going. We're making this up as we go along. What an epic journey this is going to be! <br><br>LETS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br><img src="http://x0f.xanga.com/67ef674507631282415206/m225118213.jpg" alt=Image></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TLSRuss.svg" alt=TLS_Russ> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TLS_Russ</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-18 11:31:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Yea most of the time human nature makes you feel sick, but every now and again if you dont give up on it something inspirational like this can happen..... </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Bert.svg" alt=Bert> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Bert</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-18 11:48:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DucatiPete.svg" alt="Ducati Pete"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Ducati Pete</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-18 12:07:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Viking.svg" alt=Viking> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Viking</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-18 12:16:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I'll mail Bic direct with the sizes for number boards.

But for us the main thing is to try and persuade Viking to write a blog on it about his experiences, Go -Go style so anyone can follow the highs and lows of a racing at this level.<br><br>Gordon is a great writer, he doesn't seem to know it yet, but he's open and honest and pours his heart out. Not many people are interested in tables of suspension settings and lap times, (on their own), but mixed up with the human element they make a good read. Don't want to burden the guy with too much extra commitments to his already mental work/prep/racing schedule but apart from getting as many photos he can, fly on the wall style, of his life this is probably the most important aspect of the project for Echo.<br><br>It's certainly not about getting a baseball cap with our name on it and contracting the poor guy to always wear it in bed at night.<br><br>The other thing is that I though it would be good to have a section on his site dedicated to the Superduke.net forum. Could be used for having a list of all the parts and spares that he might need. Last thing we want is for him to miss races because of some bit that has to be ordered or something. He could post up a list of essential bits and a wish list for parts that would help. Any forum members that wanted to donate a part could just ship is off to him. <br><br>Big, expensive bits could always result in a graphic credit being added to the graphics for the next race! </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-20 04:15:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>On the Facebook front....<br><br>Viking does have a Facebook page now but whether he wants everyone to friend him there is up to him.

Biggest problem is that the huge global companies like Unilever, Molson Coors etc will have their own departments that deal with PR and sponsorship and they will be locked down and hard to access, even for us working with the senior marketing teams on branding. <br><br>The smaller companies are a better bet because we're dealing with the decision makers and sometimes even the owners. But they have much smaller budgets and far less money to throw away.<br><br>Problem with WD40 is that they are kind of neither of the above. Big US company, relatively small UK operation. It's driven out of the US but we work for regional UK brands and they wouldn't have the clout to authorise sponsorship I don't think. Ironically, we have a big presentation to them today, maybe if the project goes well we can put it to them. Better if we do this once we have a bike liveried up at the end of next week. Patience and tactics eh <br><br>We used to work for Shell. Wow, if that was the case now I could get Viking free Advance oil for life!!!! I do know some people there and was thinking about contacting them. Same thing as above though, better for them to see we are up and running first and that we are serious. In the 1990s I designed all the consumer lubricant packaging for BP. The graphics have changed but it's still the bottle I created al those years ago. Don't have any contacts there now I'm afraid, they've probably all died of old age!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-20 06:31:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>On the parts front.<br><br>meant to sayg ood one TLSRuss! </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Jermo.svg" alt=Jermo> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Jermo</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-20 11:01:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Good start would be a thread in the Wanted section.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/motoronin.svg" alt=motoronin> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">motoronin</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-20 11:15:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Good skills guys... </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/41KS.svg" alt=41KS> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">41KS</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-20 11:27:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Viking.svg" alt=Viking> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Viking</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-21 22:28:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Keep reading this and still struggling to take it in.

It was only unveiled to the staff yesterday so it's very new. It's not been applied to anything yet, no printing of cards or stationery, no applications. <br><br>Viking's bike is the first place this will be ever seen in public.<br><br>What I love about this identity is that it's for a branding company. Echo create identities, logos, and the whole way brands look and feel. One of the golden rules about branding is that your logo, (or the mark that represents your brand - like the Nike tick), does not change. It's locked down totally. You cannot mess with it.<br><br>But we have broken all the rules. We have multiple brand marks. So everyone in the company can have a unique identity because that's what they are. We've actually designed and crafted 20, that's probably enough because with a versatile colour pallette there are hundreds of combinations.<br><br>But if you look the typography is very clever. They are all different with different personalities but they all look like they are the same brand. They all occupy exactly the same space and they all have exactly the same weight. You could take any one of these echo logos and swap them over and they would work as well and not upset the balance of anything. On their own they are beautiful, but together they are better. This is exactly what we wanted to achieve and it will cause a stir when we start PRing what we've done. We'll get a story in the design world with or without a bike but this will be even better!<br><br>I'm very proud of what we've done here and especially proud of the skills of my design director Ashley Carter and my co-creative director Nigel Ritchie.

Hope everything goes to plan, usually in this situation I'd have a designer on site to make sure that things went right but due to location and timing it's not possible.<br><br>I've managed to get tomorrow free so I'm going to ride up to Rockingham and finally get to meet Viking and spend the day measuring up every panel correctly so that we can get the second generation design right and fully exploit all the panels available.<br><br>Anglesey is the real first opportunity for us to launch the Echo identity and we'll probably keep any PR exposure of this first weekend to a minimum. Timings mean that we just haven't been able to get anything else ready. We have no continuity to our existing website or corporate look at all and we we need the next month to gear up.<br><br>But this Has given us a steep learning curve about the process of design for a bike, dealing with a vinyl supplier and how to logistically work. Best thing really is that I know that the design team has to realise that to get standout on a race track you have to be REALLY BOLD! Our first design is relatively subtle. It has very considered typography, (it might look thrown together but it's not), but I think that when we see photos of it on track or TV footage they will begin to realise that it's actually really subtle and doesn't have enough impact.<br><br>Much of the type is too small and our corporate colour pallete, (all secondary colours) don't have the same impact as primary and dayglo colours. (Think about Rossi's colour palette. It gives you a migraine!!!) But they are quick learners. Next time we will have evolved the design based on what they see from this time.<br><br>Anyway, on Monday Viking spent all day in agony waiting for us to send though our proposed design. Today it's my turn to wait until about 2 or 3 o'clock to see a phone photo of the bike after L&amp;Rdesigns have done their thing.<br><br>Can't wait! </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/nampus.svg" alt=nampus> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">nampus</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-26 11:34:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I really like the design!

A man of your word. I like that! Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'll pm you the info.<br><br><br>Testing went well. Bic took lots of pics so I'll get him to post them up.<br><br>Bikes not a million miles away. Getting a lot of attention and praise after every session. Seem to be on pace. We times series leader at consistent 1min 33's. I'm doing 1min 35's with a best so far of 1.35.07. Not riding fully balls out banzai onnit so feel I could hit those times with a few laps tucked in behind him. Recognise 4 or 5 of the front running bikes from tv. Doesn't seem a lot in it. They're a lot more consistent and cut through traffic better than me though. It's taking a bit of time to get used to running so close to other bikes. They're going to allow me to race with the camera on so will have the full footage from all races to keep for posterity. <br>Really awesome championship. Everyone is really friendly and supportive. It's like one big family right through all classes. <br><br>Has a good bit banter with Fast Bikes journo and ex Battle rider Alister Fagan. He'd been watching me testing and was really complimentary. Made my day! Going to have a chat about setups etc at some point over the weekend. Bike is pretty good though. Just be more for gaining knowledge on my part.<br><br><br>Qualifying tomorrow then 2 races. That's where it counts so we'll see how it goes. Think I've done too many laps on that rear tyre today. Moving a bit on the throttle and pumping on the shock. See how it goes tomorrow. Forecast is for rain Sunday for TV day so that might help us.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/omky756.svg" alt=omky756> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">omky756</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-27 19:57:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Good to hear you had a good day, really looking forward to the video's! </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-27 22:52:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Yo Bic.!!!!<br>Dude...we know you're busy....<br>But...<br>What's up with the pics bro.????<br> <br>Kodamm!!!!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Linga.svg" alt=Linga> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Linga</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-27 23:16:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Man, I got problems!!!<br><br>350 miles round trip at totally illegal motorway speeds, get back and my shoulders and neck and back are killing.

If so an SDR engine for Summer 2013 would see you a bit closer BHP wise to the GXR750s. Maybe if we could find a crashed SDR or engine it would be a chance to get a bit more of level playing field. I'm certainly no expert but shoving a set of higher bars on a sports bike and then being able to claim it's a naked bike is surely not in the spirit of the race. </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-31 16:02:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>They're doing it that way to get a bigger grid together. I dont see how they need to as there's plenty SD's, SDR's, Tuono's, Street triples, Speed Triples, Ducati Streetfighters etc out there. Thats the way it is so just have to get on with it.<br><br><br>I'm running a 2005 bog standard SD. Only engine mods are a set of Leo Vince end cans, Rottweiler Air box and flies and shafts removed and a PC3 fitted and mapped to suit. Just all the very basics really. Bike had done 9,000 miles when i bought it. I did 1000 road miles then tracked it. So it's maybe on 10,500 now? Dunno.<br><br>I'm not going to throw money at it mate. I'd be better just selling it and buying an SDR and working from there if i wanted more power.<br><br>It's kinda...........this is the bike i have. So this is what i'm gonna race. <br><br><br>I see what Petes saying. But the higher bars can be compensated for with fork springs and oil height. These things aint standard GSXR750's either. Sitting behind them in the holding area they're all dripping with Ohlins shocks, K tec forks, Brembo monoblocks etc.<br><br>I like the bike. Not too fussed about the power as what it has just now is nice to ride. <br><br><br>If i can get it to handle and stop and get my riding up to spec and be inch accurate every lap it can run up there. There's more time to be had in me than adding 20bhp. <br><br>The Metzelers seem to like to be ridden on the slide a bit. My riding has leapped forward miles in that one weekend. LIke, i'm easily 50% better than i was on friday moring. By sunday i could feel the tyre start to slide and just hold it just on the move all the way out the corner. Talking to alot of the guys....say on a scale of sliding 100% is a complete hightside and 0% is the tyre starting to move. The Metzelers need to work in that slidey zone, say 20-60% on that scale. I was taking the tyre to 5% and thinking it was at 95%. Wrong. This is the tyre starting get into the sweet zone where it should be like that every single corner. Now i've felt it lap after lap after lap it's now normal so i know where it needs to be. <br><br>You'll hear it in the engine in the vids. In about 6 weeks the full 30min I Player show will be out and show bothfll sunday races more indepth so thet'll be the best one to watch rather than the Motors TV 15min highlight skim over.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Viking.svg" alt=Viking> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Viking</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-31 17:10:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>So, finally got to find time at the studio to collect together a design team and my design director to review our first attempt at applying the new echo branding to vIkings bike. On the whole it worked out OK given the pressure we were under last week to turn it around. We also had to go on a learning curve about the vinyl production process and having to set up a reliable dialogue with L&amp;Rdesigns so we could discuss things like time lines and processes.<br><br>But now we have the luxury of a couple of weeks to get the next design sorted. Spent most of Friday measuring up Viking's panels that haven't been exploited in the past by most Superduke owners. There's, I would guess, about twice as much real estate to play with than we originally had.<br> <br>This time it 's going to be much better and have more impact and standout. We're also going to do his helmet and some sort of large banner designs to make hisnhome more welcome when he comes in from the track! <br><br>If any forum members know of a good place that can produce these large banner type things let me know. Not sure if L&amp;M do them, if not we need another supplier sorted out quickly. It 's another place that we 'd be willing to put a Superduke.net logo.<br><br>ONe thing that I noticed was that the pucker teams, and a lot of the independent guys too, have very branded look gazebos, bikes, kit etc. It really makes them look more serious and professional. I think Vikings bike got a lot of attention, ( which obviously I l am happy with) but there's more to it than that. People take notice of things. If there was an interest from a bigger sponsor, or if there was someone walking about like a talent spotter then more likely to be intrigued by Viking if he 's well presented and looks like others are already interested in him already. There's loads of guys there who just enjoy racing but their bikes and their set up look shabby and amateur. Seriously, there's bikes there held together with gaffer tape and barely make it through scrutineering. I, personally wouldn't sponsor someone like that, no way. It's a reflection of what they are as a person and what I'd have to deal with every day.<br><br>If we get Viking looking good, then it will have an effect of how he is perceived by the rest of the paddock, by the race organisers, by potential big money backers, by everyone. maybe even himself? Everything helps in this game I believe. He already had talked with the race organisers at Rockingham and got a tips about how to get more exposure on camera and how to increase the chances of race commentators mentioning Echo. He's a likeable guy and he can make an impact where ever he gets a chance. The more I con do to help him with this them better.<br><br>Racers like him. I could tell. They come talk to him and stay and chat. They find him later and carry on the conversation. <br><br>This is such an exciting project for me. I don't have time for it, it's summer and many of my team are on holiday including two of my business partners. I have to get up at 4 in the morning to fit this Viking stuff in. <br><br>But you know what? I don't mind cos it's a pleasure.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DucatiPete.svg" alt="Ducati Pete"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Ducati Pete</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-31 20:05:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Race 2 of the weekend will be up in about 3-4 hours all going well with my internet connection. <br><br></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-07-31 21:12:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Jermo.svg" alt=Jermo> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Jermo</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-08-01 03:35:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hey Pete.<br><br>Well no. I have no experience with any kind or racing. <br><br>But I have 30 plus years of riding bikes with all sorts of different kind of people, from cafe racers to hardcore greasy bikers.

But if someone can't be bothered to to repair something well or not clean something on the outside as part of preparation for a race, then I wouldn't trust what was going on on the inside of the bike either. It's a state of mind as much as a physical thing in my opinion. It's like if you went into a bike workshop and there was tools and muck lying around on the floor and piles of rubbish and cups full of cold tea spilt everywhere. Or go into somewhere and it's all ordered, (not necessarily new and shiny), and and there's a feeling of karma.

The one that bugs me the most is the right hand side tail unit, the panel below the number board should not be White, it should be coloured stripes. <br><br>How did the panels fit? Was ther a lot of post finishing to do? I hope not but it might be expected as we did not have a bike to trial them on.

Then there's Ben who did a lot of the conceptual work and next to him is Ash, our design director who's overseen the design and implementation of our new identity,(For which he can be thanked for), throughout the whole project, then Niall who submitted one of the dog mascot design concepts, (Vilking's second choice). In the middle row, in the blue jacket, is "G" the designer responsible for the lairy second generation bike graphics, next to him is Bronnie, who's project managed the whole affair and co-ordinated everything to run smoothly and then Philip who did all the layouts and panel work to get the new design to fit onto the belly-pan and helmet. Then there's Christie, one of senior senior designers, who produced the beautiful winning mascot design.

It was good to throw a few ideas about with you. <br><br>I've managed to get a deal on an STM. That should hopefully sort out my issues. These is no point in getting on the front row to then end up 8th by turn one. It looks the same as the Suter. I think i have to change from spring type to diaphram to sort this crap out.<br><br><br><br>Anyway.................race reports............especially for you DP x x <br><br>Testing was shite. Damp, then rained, then red flagged so got 8 laps over 3 sessions. I've never done the Coastal layout so was keen to get some laps in. Ive done one day there but i was in inters group and it was my 1st trackday this year after the big crash and 6month off the bike. So learned bugger all and as piss slow.<br><br>New rear tyre on for qually which was on the friday due to the big Anglesey Super Prix races. Got out mid pack and took my time scrubbing the tyre in and trying to get some space and rythym. I knew the lap record was set at 1.12.341 so set a personal goal of a sub 1.15. Saw a 1.17 on the lap timer. Got some clear track finally and got a committed lap in only to get to the entry to the corkscrew to find a guy cruising along so had to go round outside of him and lost time. Came in pissed off and Curtis ran over and told me i'd got 3rd. <br><br>Cheers to Russ for driving 5hours across counrty to listen to me rant and then have day two cancelled. Hopefully he'll have some good pics of the rage filled race two.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/omky756.svg" alt=omky756> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">omky756</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-08-27 23:40:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Good job Gordon.!!!<br>Looking forward to the videos...<br> </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Jermo.svg" alt=Jermo> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Jermo</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-08-28 00:32:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Nice write-up Flash, looking forward to especially the 2nd race with all the passes </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/nampus.svg" alt=nampus> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">nampus</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-08-28 17:45:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Gordon, well done! </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Viking.svg" alt=Viking> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Viking</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-08-28 18:07:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Great job!

It'll be a few days before i get the nightmare of race 2 up. <br><br>I've left it full length to show the full experience from pit to pit. Just skip it forward to the race if you cant be bothered watching it. <br><br>I can see my biggest problem is being inconsistant with lines etc. Reece is perfect every lap. My pace isnt far away and if i can hit every apex perfectly over the full race the overall race time will come down and i'll place higher. It's something i know it have to work on and ive got steps in place to sort it. I find its real easy to watch the vid back and pick faults and for me to slate myself, but when your out there in a race and can hear the bike behind in your ear it makes it hard to do everything perfectly. It more a survival mode you get into. <br><br> I'm working on throttle pic up too, but the vid isnt accurate enough to show the little slides you feel from the rear. That slide on lap one at the right hander at Peel corner looks small on the vid but i was right off the side of it and had to pull myself back on the bike. I notice the cam only really picks up the engine noise once it's fully open and the Rottweiler box is roaring. <br><br>Really handy having it to watch back though. That lap where i backed off to settle for 3rd and lost concentration you can really see the difference it made and i ran wide on 3 corners until i got back on it. <br><br>Excuse the crap wheelies. I could hardly breathe at the end let alone hoist it up .<br><br>This race was the 12.30 race exactly 1 year on from the funeral. Quite why i feathered that clutch back in when it snatched and got an ok start i'll never know. It's something i've never done before and didn't do it in race 2. Freaks me out a bit thinking about it. <br><br></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Viking.svg" alt=Viking> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Viking</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-08-29 07:32:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Minor mistakes are very very easy, you sort of do them for some weird natural instinct, but can never explain them.<br><br>FWIW i had terrible trouble with race starts using slipper clutches, both on my 916 and my 750k1. Rarely did i end up going into turn 1 anything more than the back end of the field. I did find with the 750 (Running a Sigma slipper) that an extra 2000rpm held on the line made it a bit more managable. But it's common for slipper clutch riders to have less starting speed than them without.

It's a buzz. I am calm and enjoying it all. The prep and buildup is enjoyable. When we get called to the holding bay I can hardly breathe, but it's weird, as soon as the visor drops and the lights go out I get calm. The heat of the race can get me going a bit but actually just lapping the bike, that's where I feel at home and it's the calmest part of the whole thing. <br><br>I find the whole racing thing super addictive. I love the mentality of it all and watching how other riders go about things. One of the things that's blew me away is how quick these guys get on pace. <br><br>My best laps when doing trackdays would always be in the afternoon after around 2 hours of trackime lapping away. But these guys don't ride inbetween races. They turn up having spent 4weeks off the bike, have a warm-up session. Then are a few seconds off lap record pace within 15mins on track. It's like in their minds there are two separate people. Visor goes down and they are on it! The series leader doesn't even have a roadbike license! <br><br>I can feel myself getting like that. But it takes me days of mental prep to get my head there. Like I do full race distances in my head on the treadmill. Visualize it all happeing from lights out to flag dropping. It works for me coz it helps take away the nerves. When I get on the grid obviously the adrenalines pumping, but I feel calmer coz I've already done 20-30 starts in my head in the weeks before.<br><br>The mental side of it is fascinating. There are points in a race weekend where it could all fall apart from one miss timed comment. What makes the front guys different is they can deal with that and instantly process it and dismiss it. There are little mind tricks played like before you go out someone will say turn 3 is really slippy. That will kill a weak man's Laptime. The strong man will acknowledge it and go out and make his own assessment. Some guy tried to mind fook me at Angelsey. We were chatting about the grabby clutch. He has no race experience, never sat there with 23 bikes around him waiting on the lights going off. He was telling me it's all in my head. No ground to say that, just trying to sound important. I fobbed it off. But repeatedly he kept tapping his temple whenever I saw him and repeating it. What I'm saying here is, that guy had no concept of the danger he was putting us in. If I got a mind fook going on about not being able to launch the bike and stalled it, without trying to sound likes drama queen, I might not be here today. As I was I basically had to have a bit of a bark at the guys and dismiss him. Then convinced myself I COULD launch it even with that bad clutch. Spoke to Rob on the way home from that meeting and he told me it was the biggest pile of shit clutch he'd ridden and to get rid of it. Takes you to the next step that shit. <br><br>What I'm getting at is. I'm not putting it on the front row through skill or talent. I did it through weeks of focus and getting my head totally in the right place and sheer determination. 70-80% of this stuff is all in the mind. I actually convince myself I'm the best rider out there </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/weeksy.svg" alt=weeksy> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">weeksy</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-09-05 15:12:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/CEREC1.svg" alt=CEREC1> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">CEREC1</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-09-05 15:31:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hi Gordon,<br>Just keep you ramblings coming.

Which ended up romping away from me on the straights. 3/4 of the way through season i bought a Gixer 750k1. Which i then raced. I finished all races in the same position on pretty much the same laptimes. The Gixer wasn't the answer for me personally to go quicker. I also didn't enjo riding it nearly as much as the 916.

If they were full price I couldn't have stretched to them.<br><br>Sale of my old wheels plus surplus parts are paying for 1/2 them. I'll hit the overtime hard over winter to pay the rest of the bill. It is an astronomical expense to me. But given the calibre of the class next year and that I'm on the back foot staying with the SD I need everything to be in place. I've got zero interest in running mid pack or making up numbers. There only reason for being out there in 2013 is to lift the Thundersport GB Championship. I'm starting to see I may actually be able to close the power gap a bit. Just a lot of small things all adding up to get me maybe 4-5bhp. <br><br>I'll still run standard cast brembos in the wet. It's going to be a pain only having 1 set of dry wheels and having to get tyres changed over between races at the track but I feel the performance will outweigh the hassle. <br><br>Dymag offer a repair service. How good that is or if I'll have to use it is unknown but it's there if needed. I heard a down side is the carbon doesn't hold heat like metal so the tyres can cool quickly. My warmers are shit hot. They'd almost the skin off your hand! And I pretty much always go at the very last minute so we should be ok. <br><br>They come with a sprocket of my choice included. So I just need to order one more rear. Between 39 and 40 t rears and 16 and 17 t fronts there's enough choice there. I've only just moved from 16/40 which I've ran everywhere for this round as it has a long straight. 16/39 with my 9950 rev limit gives me a 147mph top speed. Never seen more that 133 on GPS log to date so I'm sure that's enough.<br><br>Rob. Are you about tomorrow.

Such a shame I'm gonna have to elbow him out the way as I barge past on the tractor on my way to a win on Saturday. </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Superdan.svg" alt=Superdan> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Superdan</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-09-15 16:04:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Jesus that bike really was destroyed in seconds </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/stalker.svg" alt=stalker> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">stalker</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-09-15 19:00:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Holy hell thats a crash!<br><br>Dude, im afraid im on nights this weekend Fri/Sat/Sun and I cant take any leave im afraid as saving it for snowboard holiday, cant even come down to watch </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TheGinReaper.svg" alt="The Gin Reaper"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">The Gin Reaper</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-09-15 19:12:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>funny as </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Superdan.svg" alt=Superdan> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Superdan</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-09-15 23:29:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>@superdan......you could call in you own incident!<br><br><br>999 - emergency services what service do you require?...... hello, yes emergency services, yes, police please........police hello yes, i'd like to report a case of tyre abuse, yes tyre abuse, please could you send PC brown to Cadwell Park ASAP...... yes i know he's not a proper biker and hasn't got a superduke but i feel he's the only copper who would understand......Yes, thank you very much....... &lt;end call&gt;<br><br>....and their you go.....off to cadwell with your blues and two's on....waving a flag for viking! yay!<br><br>right ....i'm pissed now so off to bed! hehe!<br><br>toodles!</div></p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="about.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="terms.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
