The power difference is significant compared to the SDR, but still it is really easy and comfy to ride on track. <br> <br>Best personal lap time on our local track (on the SDR) was 1:32,05. <br>After 2 days on the RC, where i have to say i was a bit conservative, best lap was 1:33,1. Not bad actually considering i 've never rode a Superbike before on track. <br> <br>To cut the long story short, on Saturday, i had some problems getting the correct temperature on my tyres (Superbike slicks), but hopefully by the evening, i had it worked out. <br> <br>On Sunday morning we had the qualifying session. From a Saturday low of 1:33,2, wearing a fresh pair of slicks, i got a flying 1:29,7 on the RC. <br> <br>I 've always thought that the RC would be a difficult bike to ride compared to the SDR, but that is sooo untrue. The bike is awesome and it's easily compared to the rideability of the SuperDuke. <br> <br>... <br> <br> <br><img src="http://i406.photobucket.com/albums/pp146/lkolomvos_bucket/RC8%20C/Club%20Race%2021062009/Other/P6200564.jpg" alt=Image></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Leonidas.svg" alt=Leonidas> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Leonidas</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-06-24 10:46:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hey - thats the way <br> <br>How did the race go ? <br> <br>any pics from the race ?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Leonidas.svg" alt=Leonidas> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Leonidas</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-06-24 11:15:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Well, once i achieved the 1:29, i ended my qualification session in order to save the tyres from wearing and myself as well. That was just a friendly club race, so that lap time got me 2nd on the grid, which was more than enough for me. <br> <br>Waiting for the race to come, i tried to set my strategy plan. Reading through the free practice and qualifying numbers, we identified my competitors. <br>I only wanted to be able to keep an eye on the guy who was first on the grid and stay there until 5-6 laps before the end of the race. Then i would try to pass... <br> <br>So, we lined up at the grid... <br> <br><img src="http://i406.photobucket.com/albums/pp146/lkolomvos_bucket/RC8%20C/Club%20Race%2021062009/IMG_7795.jpg" alt=Image></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/snow.svg" alt=snow> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">snow</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-06-24 11:37:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Thats a great picture and with you in "almost" pole position, well done <br> <br>Where is your umbrella lady ?? - look like the pole position guy have it sorted out pretty well - but number 5 is a little funny - a semi nacked guy in leathers as umbrella guy <br> <br>I guess its hot in Greece now ? <br> <br>result to come in next post I guess ??????????</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Leonidas.svg" alt=Leonidas> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Leonidas</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-06-24 11:49:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Everything was perfect, but there was one thing we forgot to test. <br>I am not at all experienced in drag races. To be frank, i 've never tried to get a good launch of my RC.

All i know is that the bike did not start and went off. <br> <br>That got me turning at K1 almost last <br> <br><img src="http://i406.photobucket.com/albums/pp146/lkolomvos_bucket/RC8%20C/Club%20Race%2021062009/IMG_7811.jpg" alt=Image></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Leonidas.svg" alt=Leonidas> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Leonidas</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-06-24 11:59:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>very sweet bike.... great job.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TwistedJester.svg" alt="Twisted Jester"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Twisted Jester</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2009-06-24 12:00:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Totally frustrated i set off chasing almost everybody... <br> <br>First 3 laps i was trying to put my pieces back together, stuck behind slower riders.
