The power difference is significant compared to the SDR, but still it is really easy and comfy to ride on track. <br> <br>Best personal lap time on our local track (on the SDR) was 1:32,05. <br>After 2 days on the RC, where i have to say i was a bit conservative, best lap was 1:33,1. Not bad actually considering i 've never rode a Superbike before on track. <br> <br>To cut the long story short, on Saturday, i had some problems getting the correct temperature on my tyres (Superbike slicks), but hopefully by the evening, i had it worked out. <br> <br>On Sunday morning we had the qualifying session. From a Saturday low of 1:33,2, wearing a fresh pair of slicks, i got a flying 1:29,7 on the RC. <br> <br>I 've always thought that the RC would be a difficult bike to ride compared to the SDR, but that is sooo untrue. The bike is awesome and it's easily compared to the rideability of the SuperDuke. <br> <br>... <br> <br> <br><img src="http://i406.photobucket.com/albums/pp146/lkolomvos_bucket/RC8%20C/Club%20Race%2021062009/Other/P6200564.jpg" alt=Image></div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Leonidas" alt=Leonidas> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Leonidas</h3> <time datetime="2009-06-24 10:46:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2009-06-24 10:46:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Hey - thats the way <br> <br>How did the race go ? <br> <br>any pics from the race ?</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Leonidas" alt=Leonidas> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Leonidas</h3> <time datetime="2009-06-24 11:15:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2009-06-24 11:15:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Well, once i achieved the 1:29, i ended my qualification session in order to save the tyres from wearing and myself as well. That was just a friendly club race, so that lap time got me 2nd on the grid, which was more than enough for me. <br> <br>Waiting for the race to come, i tried to set my strategy plan. Reading through the free practice and qualifying numbers, we identified my competitors. <br>I only wanted to be able to keep an eye on the guy who was first on the grid and stay there until 5-6 laps before the end of the race.
