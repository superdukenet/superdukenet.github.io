Usually I wouldn't whine about such things, but this particular problem had the potential to have been very very serious.<br><br>On Monday, I got the bike out of the shed where it had remained all weekend. When the ignition was turned on, fuel sprayed at high pressure all over the top of the front cylinder, dripping down over the block and exhaust headers. Luckily, the engine was stone cold at the time. A rubber pipe between the fuel pump and the injectors had split at the 90deg elbow (had split on the <span style="font-weight: bold">inside</span> of the elbow!). I don't know the part number of the pipe, but it's black, L-shaped with the long side about 20cm long with a metal pressure fitting on one end. As the dealer explained it, the fuel injection system is at max pressure when you turn the bike on; the fuel pump runs to prime and pressurize the system. This pressure had caused the pipe to burst. The amount of fuel sprayed wasn't small either; hard to say the exact amount, but I'd estimate 40-50 ml.<br><br>This happened when the bike was stone cold. All that happened was the bike that wouldn't start and I got some petrol on my shoes. Big deal. However, I really don't want to think about what would have happened if the bike had been at full operating temperature when the pipe split - for instance, just after filling it up with fuel as a gas station. Fuel was dripping over the exhaust headers. Hot engine, even hotter exhaust headers and petrol - isn't too hard to guess what the result could have been.<br><br>The dealer replaced the pipe under warranty, but really didn't think it was that important. I've Googled for "superduke fireball" and various other relevant search terms but haven't found anything. Has anyone else seen anything like this?<br><br>P.S.<br><br>This isn't the first hose to let go on that bike either. A few months ago, the coolant return pipe from the radiator let go whilst riding, pumping out most of the coolant in the system down the right-hand side of the bike and all over my leg. Luckily, I was only a couple of minutes from home so the coolant was only warm. Ten minutes later though, it would have been at full temperature. Being covered in water and glycol at 90deg+ is not a pleasant idea...</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ShadeTheChangingMan.svg" alt=ShadeTheChangingMan> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">ShadeTheChangingMan</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-02-20 11:07:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Never heard of eithere of these happening before. What is your maintenance regime regarding cleaning and products used? I am sure youve got it covered but i am wondering if there is ,aybe some productg you use that is perishing the pipes?

Apparently the broken fuel line's to be sent back to KTM in Austria for examination to find out what went wrong. In general, all rubber hoses on the bike look fine. Whilst I have used kero to clean the chain and remove dried chain lube from various bits of the bike, it would have never come into contact with that fuel pipe - certainly not in the place where it split. And I should hope that pipes carrying fuel would be fairly resistant to petroleum-based solvents anyway... Other than that, all I use to clean the bike is car shampoo gloop, car polish and occasionally some Mr Muscle furniture polish. Don't laugh - it's good for getting rid of dried chain lube.<br><br>In retrospect, the description of the coolant hose failing was a little misleading. The pipe itself didn't actually break; it simply popped off the metal pipe it's usually connected to. The dealer simply connected it back up and tightened the connector. The mechanic reckoned it must not have been connected properly at the factory and something had caused it to suddenly come loose (like the rather inexpert wheelie I'd just performed).<br><br>For those interested, the pipe that split is this one:<br><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5294/5463643862_57e5ccee72.jpg" alt=Image><br>The location of the split is almost impossible to photograph, but it was the inside of the 90deg elbow where it enters the airbox.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ShadeTheChangingMan.svg" alt=ShadeTheChangingMan> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">ShadeTheChangingMan</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-02-21 07:13:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Ah, thqt changes things a fair bit then eh mate? Fuel line coupling coming lose is a bitndiffereent to a silicon hose rupturing. Glad it was a simple fix for ya. And yeah, prolly just factory staff not doing their job right. Still very bad of course but maybe not component failure. In fact, every time you have the tank up you are likely to need to break this connection so get used to making that connection yourself. Its not tricky, just a tight space for banana fingered men like us amd the hose doesnt have much lenght in it for maneuvre.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/harvester.svg" alt=harvester> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">harvester</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-02-21 07:35:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Once upon a time..
