I never owned a KTM before (some previous bikes - "07" r1, "06" gsxr750, "05" r1,)<br>or a even naked bike for that matter.. have stopped racing so wanted a great weekend bike.. that i could also use on the track. The dukes aggressive appearance and the reviews that raved about the handling had me hooked. <br><br>Found a great deal and jumped right in ( bought a 2007 black superduke 3500kms) but i have had some set backs. Firstly the build quality is a bit less then i am used too.. most of the bolts have rusted . <br><br>So not to be detered i replaced every one of them. The brake lever also looked abit rusted, or brake fluid had run over it and I decided to replace it..... until i called the dealer... THE PARTS ARE INSANELY PRICED.. To be honest I am the first one I know to own one..but Ducati's have nothing on our pricing....<br><br>I also had a new set of tyres fitted, Mitchelin power race 2 ---- On the way home i got an insane wobble at about 160kms /h ... I see this could be due to tyre pressure... or a weak neck bolt etc.. Will hopefully sort it out this weekend. <br><br>I love the look and reputation or the Superduke but i'm wondering if this is just "Hype" don't get me wrong i'm with you guys... i really want it to be great... just need some re-assurance it's not a lemon....<br><br> <br><br>Dave</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AndersH.svg" alt=AndersH> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AndersH</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-08 21:53:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>When it's great - it's really great!

Just like a Hypermotard/SMR is nothing flash. Any bike will perform as well as the rider demands of it. The hyper/Superduke/motard is not better than any sportsbike in any corner. It is purely down to rider control that dictates how a bike handles.<br><br>If a bike intimidates you then get rid of it and buy any other bike. Theres literally thousands to choose from. None of us "need" more than 80rwhp unless we are track day junkies. A stock SD wheelies like a maniac and should put a smile on even a blind mans face. Headshake, wobbles poor fueling, grabby brakes etc etc etc..get used to it or get rid of it.<br><br>Sorry to rain on your parade, but rider training would solve millions of complaints about this and that from the biker community. Any bike in stock form is good enough to go scratching on and have a farking ball! If theres a problem just ride around it. If you cannot ride around it then perhaps a safer sport is what is needed over a mechanical correction.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DaveySprocket.svg" alt="Davey Sprocket"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Davey Sprocket</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-09 09:37:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hi Mr ktm.. thanks for the info...

The SD is a brilliant machine, like all other bikes. It comes down to the rider and what they can get out of their respective bike.<br><br>If you feel a bike is too much then sell it and buy another. I make a definite point of changing bikes every couple of years as there is allways something better coming out. I did the SD thing, loved it and then got a Hypermotard. Loved it waaay more than the SD. But soon there will be something waaay better than the Hyper and I'll buy that.<br><br>I get sick to death of people winging about this and that about bikes when it simply comes down to the fact they dont know enough about riding to tell the difference between a corner and a straight and what to do with either. Heard it all from what tyre do I buy to what sags should I set. Tell them exactlky what to do and they still whinge about something else. <br><br>If you can't ride a stock SD and have a shitload of fun then get rid of it and buy a 50cc scooter. Argue against that and I rest my case, stick to the scooter.<br><br>Spend more time in the saddle and all your answers will be solved.<br><br>Enjoy your SD, its one helluva bike!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Jody.svg" alt=Jody> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Jody</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-09 10:03:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DaveySprocket.svg" alt="Davey Sprocket"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Davey Sprocket</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-09 10:09:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Thanks for the point Jody.. i'm sure it's just the uncertainty of somthng new!!!

Glad to see you enjoying your machine.<br><br>I would comment that you are one of the very few people I have ever come across who think that KTM's build quality was a bit under par. I've owned about 25 proper bikes over the years, 6 were KTMs, and IMO recent machines have been peerless in build quality and chassis parts (Brembo, Nekken, Marchesini, WP, Akrapovic - all OE), esp compared to Ducati, Triumph and pretty much anything without a Honda badge - although and even my Honda Hornet rusted around the bottom yoke and shock assembly in just one winter.<br><br>As for it being a lemon - you'll find most SD owners have ridden or owned most big bikes, so it's usually a very considered buy, by experienced bikers who ofetn own other bikes at the same time. We are constantly comparing it to the other big capacity streetbikes, and are smart enough to buy the best without too much blind brand loyalty - and generally speaking it still comes out as one of the very best, esp in terms of pure fun and handling.<br><br>The only common complaint is snatchy fuelling - although much more on the SDR - which also has a seat like a plank of wood (unlike your SD). <br><br>Enjoy, and be prepared to never want to part with it.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DaveySprocket.svg" alt="Davey Sprocket"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Davey Sprocket</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-09 11:25:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hi Dutch, I was drawn to all the trick bits of the superduke (wp, brembo) .. doing alot of trackdays i was planning and eating up some of my mates on bikes you just described...

Grendel's own steed is the same year and has none of the mentioned issues. Therefore Grendel thinks the original owner was a prat. didn't take care of it. Rusted fasteners are an indication of this type of neglect. There are some forum members who have had rusted fasteners due to their riding season or the storage they have, however they noticed it and fixed it. <br><br>Sounds like this bike finally has an owner that will take care of it.

As i'm writing this, it does seem suspension related.. maybe even wrong profile tyre.. better double check in the morning..</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bagsey.svg" alt=bagsey> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bagsey</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-30 00:42:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MrZ32.svg" alt=MrZ32> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">MrZ32</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-30 01:00:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>try adding a few clicks of rebound to the rear<br><br>Also are each fork tube set to the same level in the triples, spring pre load, same oil height and dampening settings?

I can ride it on the way home in the heat and in traffic, but when I pull up and open the garage door, I am smiling. The RC8R, gets close, but the little bastard Super Duke ALWAYS makes me giggle at some point when I am riding it. I am 230 pounds, I have short legs, so I tiptoe on the Super Duke, I set the sag, about 40 mm in front, about 35 mm in the rear and put on some Michelin Pilot Powers. The thing handles almost as well as my GSXR 750 did at the track. She is pretty quick steering and I ride with rearsets up and back from stock, forces me forward slightly. But overall, the Super Duke is fun at my 52 yr old pace at the track. The RC8R will be another level or so up, but the Super Duke is fun. I got to outbreak my buddy that was riding my old SM 610 in a slow corner, block pass him and power out. It was sweet with the rear stepping out as stuff. Super Duke is the business, keep tweaking her. Mine has the forks up about 4-5 mm in the triples.
