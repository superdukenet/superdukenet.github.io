We both had work obligations this year but this summer we both have the time and want to get the ball rolling. The idea, ride and see as much as possible and ending up in croatia. For one would be really intrested to hearing what bike some of you guys would recommend for something like this. Pretty much if I could give you any bike to ride everywhere from lisbon, barcelona to amsterdam, berlin, alps, prague ending up in croatia what bike would it be? Any bike and the idea of travling as light as possible. <br><br>In all its about 3500 miles maybe 4000 in 2 months if you include some other spots but I think you get the idea. Any other thoughts are welcome of course but I want a couple ideas on bikes just to give me something to motivate myself and well, we all have SD's and I trust most wont be offering up a goldwing as a option. I'm 33 and dont want to tour europe on a something like that, I can do that as part 2 when I'm 55. I'm a intermediate / experienced rider and have plenty of canyon / trackday / even some race miles now under my belt now. Done trips up and down the california coast but thats on a 1198 and for storage options your just to limited and feel after the 1st week I might be second guessing my ride. Honestly I almost want to do it on a SD and not necessarily counting that out. What do you guys think?

You also with the RC8 get wind protection which turns into something rather nice after 6 hours straight on a road, and when your not straight well it can do that too.

Most of the EU is on about 20 % gst minimum but there are place where you can buy a vehicle without tax or lower tax. One solution is Andorra, Liechtenstein and so but I guess that is difficult. Another one is that you don't pay taxes and GST as long as you export the vehicle out of the EU. This will save you loads but you need paperwork and as mentioned you need to get rid of the bike outside the EU.<br><br>At RedZX about the BMW.

If you still want to kick some ass, but need to sit upright a bit more, stick a touring screen and an SD and blast away!

Any of you UK guys know how long that permit or transfer plate for anyone from outside the country is good for when they pick up a bike in your back yard? Is it that they are riding on the remainder of your registration for that year? Germany has a export plate good for a year, Austria, Netherlands, I hear even italy but its impossible to get for the most part or not worth the time. <br><br>I know I could <br>1) use a friend in said country and simple as that it gets registered to them, they let me ride it. The only thing I find alittle scary about this is all the borders I have to cross on a bikes thats not in my name. Could this not be a serious problem?<br><br>2) Use a friend as address only for registration and insurance and get a letter or some form of proof I live there for some amount of time. Kind of like a 2nd home vacation house in another country. <br><br>3) Export plates, from whatever country that provides this, then you must provide proof the bike has left the EU within the year of the permit. This could work out seeing as the trip ends in croatia (outside EU at least last I checked). I guess I could be met with paying taxes at the border but I have no clue<br><br>As for bike, I know its not really the biggest part but I like the motivation. If it came down to it I would do it on anything that runs well. I must admit the RC8 would be awesome and not ness letting that little dream go but when I weight it all I think picking up 2 superdukes would be ideal. Its something I already know and that could come in handy, plus its just a sick bike, thats why we all have them.<br><br>I did check out Air freighting the bikes over, 1 its pricey when its all said and done using standard rates its 2700 to 3000 with paperwork a bike. There are other opprotunities in which shipper bid on your weight to fill empty space. As this could become an option I get a little uneasy about it. Showing up finding out you bike hasnt left yet, you have already paid, your fcked. There are a couple stories I have read where one guy waited for his bike for a whole fcking month and to top it off had to go to another country to get it. I will see, thanks again and if anyone has any tips on the legal side of buying let me know thanks </div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=easze76" alt=easze76> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">easze76</h3> <time datetime="2011-01-19 05:42:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-01-19 05:42:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=shadowman" alt=shadowman> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">shadowman</h3> <time datetime="2011-01-19 10:07:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-01-19 10:07:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Just get the bike registered in your name at any UK address. I'm sure somebody on here would let you use their address, if not then you would be welcome to use mine. Most of the borders between European countries are notional, there are no checkpoints or paperwork checks at all thanks to a thing called the Schengen agreement. The only time you are likley to have paperwork looked at is between UK and the rest of Europe (although I have never had even my passport looked at in detail when getting off the ferry) and when leaving or re entering the EU.
