be asked by the local stealer to have a pre-premiere go on the new Monster 1200S, and give them some feedback on it. BTW the US Premiere is tomorrow, April 5th, 2014. Most stealers will have some flavor of the 1200 for you to try. If you have a choice, just skip the standard one.<br><br>My ride was urban, with some bits of freeway (most ramps and run-up blasts) and a couple of short, somewhat hidden, twisty bits in the vicinity. I was the only one to have ridden it, except for one of their mechanics who set it up (also the shop's suspension guru - a really candid Argentine guy). Even <br>though not at first service mileage - I still rode it like I stole it. The other guys at the dealer just hadn't had opportunity.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">The Good:</span><br><br>- I'll start by saying that it is the best, as in most-refined and tractable Ducati I've ridden. Even in "Sport" mode - with it's quick-early throttle response, it was never jerky or fluffy at any point. Nor was it soft in anything but "Urban" mode. And then, not lame - just soft<span style="font-style: italic">er</span>.<br><br>- Default ride modes (engine management + TC mode + ABS mode) are intelligently chosen, to where the bike will appeal to wide range of riders and skill levels. The baby "Urban" mode felt more like my SD990, except that it had much smoother throttle response. In this mode however, it doens't pull like the 990 at the top of the rev range. Probably a good thing for newbies, or for getting used to the bike and break-in. I began in "Sport" and spent most of my time riding in this mode. More power is better, right? <br><br>- Regardless the map, the throttle felt as visceral and connected as any direct-to-TBs cable-linkage setup. No weirdness or lag whatsoever; on or off throttle.<br><br>- Engine was smooth, regardless how fast it was turning, or in what gear (and I did lug it): 90-degree v-twins, what can I say that hasn't been already?<br><br>- The TC was perceptible, but more audibly than through the chassis. Not like the original DTC of just 5 or 6 years ago. Ducati has come a long way with their electronics.<br><br>- It easily out-muscles any SD 990. Back to that "nothing beats cubic inches". It has absolutely stonking mid-range torque in Sport mode. Ducati says 145 HP - which we all know is Duc B.S. ... But "Butt Dyno" doesn't rule out 125 to 130 RWHP. <br><br>- Want wheelies? Not a problem - even in 3rd. Yes, TC can be turned off (too) - easily.<br><br>- The big monoblock Brembos clamped the big, thick discs like there was no tomorrow - every time. Want stoppies? You can have them. Very effective, very fast - yet not the traditional Ducati newb-bike-dumping initial bite. On the "S", these are track-worthy brakes. I could only get them so hot on the street; I'd need a few repeated 140-to-50 mph corner entries to see what fade they exhibit ... Not happening on a street ride.<br><br>- The ABS was as good as any I've experienced - not overly intrusive, nor did the Brembo monoblocks go to waste due to a lack of level feel/feedback. Slightly more numb than w/o ABS, but what are you gonna do? You CAN turn off the ABS, but it doesn't change the feel. <br><br>- The extra dosh for the Ohlins goods on the "S" is worth the money. Undersprung for my fat ass (what isn't?), but if you're averaged size, you're probably going to be real happy. The wrench who rode it before me is a waif, and considering he selfishly (who can blame him?) set it up for himself, it was damn good.<br><br>- The included slipper clutch works well, and was unobtrusive when intentionally abusing it; I was unable to get it to freewheel. I'd need a race track to see what it does under real duress. The clutch (hydraulically actuated, wet), had smooth take up, and worked as well as anything Japanese. Good feel, as I would occasionally feather it on launch in Sport mode (tight traffic urban + splitting).<br><br>- It has the quickest and smoothest shifting Duc transmission I've experienced. I think after the first 2 upshifts, I never touched the clutch again for an upshift. It would change gears as fast as I could unload the dogs, move the lever, and twist the throttle (and to the stop - in any mode). I can be on occasion a little lightfooted on upshifts, and found that classic 5th-to-6th false-neutral that every Ducati ever seems to have ... but only a couple of times when I was being sloppy while accelerating, pinning the throttle after each shift. It just amplified how farm-implement my 990's transmission and shifting are.<br><br>- I wish I'd had more opportunity to exploit its handling. It seems track worthy out of the box: Quick steering response, yet contradictorily stable - and no steering damper. I don't think it really needs one, but if I were tracking it, I would want one. Full-throttle upshifts, front wheel skimming, yeah, you can get it to headshake. It turned in nice, and the range before the locks isn't too bad; I could u-turn where needed (I did this in a few places).<br><br>- Ergos: If you're smaller person, or short on inseam - you'd love it as-is. More on this follows. Bars were well placed for me, and felt good (subjective, and anatomically dependent). No strain on the wrists whatsoever, and no numbing vibes.<br><br>- It has a metal tank. Real-deal metal! Guess the bean counters decided it was better than replacing all those plastic ones forever.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">The Stupid:</span><br><br>- The foot placement ... Ugghhhh ... if you have a size 6 girls foot - GTG. For my size 11 dogs in street boots, screwed. Ducati uses those idiotic castings that integrate both the rider and pillion pegs. Between the the pillion peg placement and the exhaust can on the right, replacement of these things (with proper rearsets) would be a must for any kind of serious track sorties. I couldn't even get close to the balls of my feet without something interfering. Know what Ducati? For the "S" - just make the bike a monoposto. Want to show off your g/f's tramp-stamp - get a cruiser or a 'busa. <br><br>- The seat - which I found comfortable (subjective) BTW - is too close to the pegs. I'm no dainty miss, but I don't have the longest legs in the land either. If you're long-limbed, you're going to suffer.<br><br>- The exhaust can, and plumbing that leads to it, is not only hideous, but about as obtrusively placed as one could come up with. I dunno WTF they were thinking (other than to sell more Ducati Performance bits ...). <br><br>- The console is kind of cheesy. It's just a display, and the only times I looked at it were to change riding modes on the fly, and an occasional glance at the speedo to affirm my stupidity. It's particularly bad if wearing polarizing eyewear (no surprise) - it does remain viewable however. The tachometer display is all but unreadable, as are the tiny indicating LED's. It was still better than an RC8's console.<br><br>- Visually, it has all the right cues, but it looks, well, cluttered. Not as tack-on as the S4/S4R/S4RS or as ridiculous as the "Streetfighter". It looks oh-so "Monster". There is no mistaking it for anything else. The clutter however, gives it a somewhat bloated appearance. The closer you look, the worse it is. It is not ugly IMO. I'm confident however, that there is a spectrum of opinions here on this.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">The "I have no idea" or "Don't Care":</span><br><br>- This was a daytime ride, so I haven't a clue as to how well the lighting works at night - I don't think I care that much, even though I ride regularly in the dark (every day, in winter). Headlight is big enough physically, and I'll assume adequate.<br><br>- I have no idea how thirsty it is. It's gotta be better than a 990 with even an Akra map. <br><br>- Cost of services ain't gonna be cheap - but I have no idea how much; was afraid to ask. Upside is that the tricky (or expensive) valve adjust interval is 30K Km (&gt;18K miles). Better than most bikes on the road today.<br><br>- I didn't bother to look at how much storage it has. I don't think I care. For my commute, I've been using a messenger bag for at least 15 years, even on my bagger (lol).<br><br>- It's Italian, and there's a lot of sophisticated electronics and sensors - longevity has to be a question: To which I have no answer. Things are much better than they once were, but, well, you know ... <br><br>- Wind protection? Really? Buy a bagger with a giant fairing if that's what you want. There isn't any. Really shouldn't be part of the discussion for this type bike. Wear leather, and hooligan around town - as it's intended for - and you won't care. The Monster IS the archetype "naked" bike. It is not a UJM "standard" of yore. It isn't a "streetfighter" either. I contend that the SD never would have happened if it weren't for the Monster's long success. Yes, its been around more than 20 years ... So what? This ain't the 1993 bike, but to be worthy of the name, you don't ask about "wind protection".<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">The Price:</span><br><br>- The stealer wants 1290 kind of money for the thing tomorrow afternoon (also vends KTM). Some will bite - it's that good. MSRP is about 16 large. Don't ask me to compare to the S1000R or SD 1290R as I haven't experienced either yet. Or the new version of the Tuono for that matter. But, I can say that if you can live with the ugly - an NOS 2013 Tuono V4R is comparable bargain. You'd have money left over after putting Ohlins bits on your Tuono. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Conclusion:</span><br><br>It is a worthy dance partner, that you could easily take home even if sober. It was muy fun. If I could get bits to sort the ergos, with a little suspension work, I could easily put one in the garage for the daily ride.<br><br>Think it's not as good as your 990? You'd be wrong. Sorry. It's the truth. Then again, I don't think I'll ever tyre of the 990's looks. Much has evolved since 2007 (first "official" entry of the SD into the US), and I look forward to my roll on the 1290R. Kind of pathetic that after all that hype, KTM can't get them to us yet. Would have been fun to do my own back-to-back.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=soarsore" alt=soarsore> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">soarsore</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2014-04-05 04:51:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2014-04-05 04:51:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Very good and detailed write up!

The vast vast majority of people will buy based on what it looks like, the image it reflects on them and what their peers will think. The number of people getting within 10% of the standard bikes performance limits is tiny. It called a monster, is made by Ducati and looks good when shiny and thus is the most powerful one they have ever made.

Just a shame it looks so middle aged man. There was nothing I found exciting about the look of the bike when I saw it at the bike show. Seat was just plain ugly and I know the headlight says Monster but its just so dated. It felt like it was built for someone of Pedrosa's height to ride. Killed my knees just trying to sit on it. I'm sure the engine is great fun but in the looks stakes it's just plain boring and ugly imo and comfort for anyone over 6" it's a massive no no</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=scamb66" alt=scamb66> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">scamb66</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2014-04-08 07:00:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2014-04-08 07:00:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <p class="italic text-gray-500">Post missing.</p> </div> </article> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2025 SuperDukeNet</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
