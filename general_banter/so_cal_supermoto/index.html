Man, it was a blast. Pretty much they have about 10 DRZ400's set up for you to rip around the track. It's not a big track since it's just a go kart track, but that just means there's a lot more tight turns. First half of the day is riding through the laps, getting used to it. Then, after lunch, the dirt section opens up and then you pretty much gotta take it slow again. It's about 15 minute a session, then break, where the go karters go have their fun, then repeat. Between sessions, the host, Brian will talk about race lines, how to ride a supermoto, gear position, etc. <br><br>The day was pretty fun. There were about 11 people there. About half were locals and the other half were either Canadian or Australian. Even had a female rider there. Apparently the influx of out of country folk came along with Victoria Supermoto up in Vancouver, Canada.<br><br>I ate it in the second session, but the fall wasn't that bad, just a bruised hip and ego. My current bike is a 5 down 1 up "race" shifting style. Not by choice, but because I was riding one day and my shifter came apart. I found out one of the bolt hole on the shifter was pretty much stripped. Luckily, KTM put in another bolt hole which'll turn it into a race style shifter. Soo... I've been riding around like that for the past few months and gotten used to it. Jumping back onto a normal bike, I had a few f*ck ups where I downshifted when I meant to upshift and vice versa. Anyways, going around one of the hairer turns, I accidently downshifted a gear too low and didn't let out the gas enough. The rear tyre locked and skipped and did whatever. I did a mini highside and somehow landed on my right hip even though I was making a right turn. I was unscathed enough to jump back up and keep riding. I have a video of the accident from a 1st person view if any of y'all wanna see my embarrassment. Another guy had a little slip, scuffed his leathers up a bit. One more at the end of the day, but that was the worse one.<br><br>Towards the end of the day, if there's enough time, they decide the run the track backwards. One guy who helps host it was telling us that pretty much the track was only meant to be run one way, and going the opposite is just insane. I decided to sit this one out, just because I was tired and I found out that I don't handle dirt all that well and I don't think going in reverse on a one way track with a dirt section would've been all that fun for me. So me and a couple other people who decided to sit out jump into the bird's nest to watch. The group starts their session, but then somehow half the group goes through the dirt section, then the other half stays on the asphalt. Brian, asks one of us to go down there to direct them all onto the dirt so there's no two lanes of traffic going on. He would've done it himself, but he broke his foot and was still in a cast. One of the guys goes down and starts to direct them into the dirt. So here comes this group of about 6 riders and into the dirt. Going into the dirt (in reverse) there's two plateaus about 6x6 then a bank that U's around to two smaller hills, more like speed bumps really. So the group starts going into the dirt, first few make it over, but once the first guy hits the U-turn, he slips and falls. The guy right behind him stops and starts waving, to signal there's a man down. A couple other guys slow down and stop, but one guy who came off the 2nd plateau a little to hard and fast. He was already a little unstable on the bike, whiskey throttled it, and went straight ahead, off the U-turn's bank. He did a mini-superman, landed on the bike like that, and then tumbled a bit. He was still conscious and willing to move, but the workers told him to stay still and called the paramedics. An ambulance, a firetruck, and two sheriffs came. The ambulance took him away on a gurney and the sheriffs made a report. Brian checked up on him today, said he's doing alright. <br><br>Anyways, since they all had to go onto the track to get to the injured motorcyclist, the sheriff and ambulance were the first to leave, so they just backed it up and went back the way the came in. The firetruck though, decided to have a bit more fun. As they started moving forward, everyone had the same look on their face, like, "No Friggin Way..." Sure enough, the firetruck went around the go kart track and halfway through, they turned on their sirens and started to honk their horn. I'm sure they were having a bit of fun before they went back to sitting around waiting for another emergency call, but it lightened the mood. All-in-all, it was a good day.<br><br>Anyways, enough talking, here's some pics.<br><br>First gallery is of me, since I'm conceited like that.<br><br><br><br>Gettin' ready.<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wqqfuA3.jpg" alt=Image><br><br>Probably my favorite turn.

It's well worth it and one of the funnest things I've ever done. Let me know as well, maybe we can arrange it and get enough people together to get the group discount. Just need 4 people and it's cheaper for the group.<br><br></div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=81forest" alt=81forest> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">81forest</h3> <time datetime="2014-05-20 20:41:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2014-05-20 20:41:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Awesome write up!
