Locking and deleting/threads isn't something just done on a whim. Guy I meant to reply to your PM but by the time I got home I simply forgot. Perhaps we were over cautious. But was it worth taking the risk? If and it's a massive if, the forum was threatened, 1: we wouldn't even know. 2: we'd just wake up one day and it would be down and there would be no way for us to know how or why. 3: even if it was done by KTM how much stink would it really cause? A similar thread on other biking forums, a few posters calling it outrageous, swearing a bit and then the thread disappearing off page 1 and into the depths of the forums like 1000s before it. There is nothing wrong with discussing the issue. There is a problem and it should be discussed. That thread bacame more than that though. I'm pretty sure a group of Ducati owners took action over this issue in the US and won. This isn't the US though and litigation just isn't that popular here (not or the lack of trying from scumbag lawyers ads on TV ) tanks vs cost of fighting the claim.
