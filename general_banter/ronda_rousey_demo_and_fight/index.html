He was more of a gimick merchant and self promotor, think Jimmy Saville as a wrestler.<br><br>It would be easy to argue he set American judo back a lot of years which I suspect is why the US could field very few Judoka ( I can only think of Michael Swain) at Olympic and World level when I was involved. Most of the top level Japanese coaches werent interested in teaching in the US as they felt the sport was trivialised by such antics.<br><br>He may have some huge number of dans in US judo now but most are probably self awarded or came from mergers of clubs and associations. Basically if you hang around the sport long enough you get awarded grades. Brian Jacks is the only guy I am aware of that fought for a 5th Dan, certainly he was the only non Japanese.<br><br>I guess he gets a lot of his status from Brazilian Ju Jitsu which is a bastardisation of Japanese Ju Jitsu with added nasty stuff, and like any bastard is desperately seeking any forebear. So in the US at least the black sheep sport has found the black sheep predecessor.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ShadeTheChangingMan.svg" alt=ShadeTheChangingMan> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">ShadeTheChangingMan</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-20 03:57:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I don't think american judo ever got off the ground in the US mainly because there was no money in it. Many Japanese shoot fighters transitioned from Judo to catch wrestling because it's more effective than judo in that type of environment. Sakuraba the "Gracie Hunter" was a shootfighter/catch wrestler, I don't think he has any traditional judo championships. Personally, I view BJJ as an extreme refinement of the ground game, were Judo is a refinement of the throwing game. Catch wrestling is a refinement of the torture game.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/StupidLuke.svg" alt="Stupid Luke"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Stupid Luke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-20 09:04:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Nice post Pete.<br><br>I dont mean to demean her fighting skills....awesome as they appear to be.....but she really is one hell of a woman!!

A lot of those throws were still permitted when I was competing. Kani basame was banned for obvious reasons but I have seen contests won with most of the others. A lot of the Korean and Russians used to do morote dori and suki nage as they were similar techiniques to those they knew from in Sombo wrestling.<br><br>Quite suprised to see Te Garuma banned as tori retains a lot of control of uke in that one. I guess the danger is that it may become a piledriver and land uke on his head at the halfway stage. It is still my favorite technique for fighting with my kids though, they have grown up watching the world turn upside down when they wont go to bed <br><br>Back in 84 I trained a fair bit with Kashiwazaki who was 81 (i think) world champion. If he were still fighting today that video would have robbed him of 80% of his throwing techniques. I reckon he would still have got by on the other 20% and the ne waza though.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/StupidLuke.svg" alt="Stupid Luke"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Stupid Luke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-23 09:19:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>GOOD video Count Zero!!

If the arm is straight it gets broken on the elbow joint. If the receipient can keep a slight bend in it it ends in a dislocation and a lot of ligament damage. I had my left elbow dislocated, just like that in the 1982 European Team championships and I can still feel it now sometimes ; mostly on cold mornings and sometimes I get a kind of arm pump at that elbow when training.<br><br>Even when you are the one with the armlock on it is a pretty unpleasant way to break someones arm as you really feel it give. Not a great feeling, or an enjoyable way to win but nothing else you can do if they dont tap out.

Now in competition if you haven't got a hold or submission in 5 or 10 seconds the fight is stopped and stood up.<br><br>This is why Ronda -who was a submission specialist - has such fast transitions. BJJ is much more methodical in approach, control, move to mount, look for submission. Ronda is from such a high level of Judo she is one step ahead.<br><br>She has also figured out that if she throws punches from mount her opponent will give her a arm while protecting themselves.<br><br>That said, I love watching the Diaz brothers work from their backs.
