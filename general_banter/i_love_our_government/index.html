If my memory serves the indigenous population was rounded up, shoved off their lands, institutionalised, killed and generally dispossessed so that my ancestors had somewhere to dump convicts and grow stuff that didn't grow here. All that just a couple of hundred years ago.<br><br>Then there is the good old USA which had it's own indigenous population management measures, none of which would look all that shiny in the light of current moral standards weather politically correct or not.<br><br>If you live in one of the ten richest countries in the world then it seems quite likely that others will want a piece of the pie.<br><br>Not to worry though, soon enough China and India will be immigration destinations themselves and their GDP's grow and if we don’t focus on being clever Europe, Australia and the US might find themselves net exporters of people which brings it's own set of problems.<br><br>Right I'm off to check my ancestry to make sure I don’t have to resent myself for being non indigenous, how long a bloodline counts as indigenous though? Let's settle on 500 years, all that have unbroken blood lines in the country they live are free to moan about bloody immigrants......</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/loony888.svg" alt=loony888> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">loony888</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-05 10:39:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/shadowman.svg" alt=shadowman> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">shadowman</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-05 11:40:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/scamb66.svg" alt=scamb66> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">scamb66</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-05 12:19:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/johnpav.svg" alt=johnpav> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">johnpav</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-05 18:18:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Did we not test nukes out there?
