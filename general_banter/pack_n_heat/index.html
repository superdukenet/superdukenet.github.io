I havent been on there for a long time but the site is huge with member no's in the tens of thousands. <br> <br>The topic title read "do you carry while riding?" or something similar and sparked some healthy debate. <br> <br>While the thought of carrying a gun here never enters my mind, I'm sure there are places in the world where one would be foolish not to. <br> <br>So.. Do any of you guys "pack" while out in the boonies or riding in general? <br> <br>Do you keep an arsenal of weapons under your pillow? Or even a 12 gauge <br>strapped under your jacket whist withdrawing from an ATM. <br> <br>I find this subject very interesting due to the fact that carrying a weapon, let alone a piece is so far from anything I would contemplate. <br> <br>I grew up in the bush on 200 acres. My Father was gun crazy and had a <br>cupboard full of rifles and hand guns. <br> <br>From memory, It sure was a great feeling to unload a clip from a hand gun <br>into the dam at 10 years old. <br> <br>There's no right or wrong here in my opinion. You either do or you don't. <br> <br>I may even try to find a link to the original thread if it still exists.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/jawk.svg" alt=jawk> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">jawk</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2008-11-20 22:04:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>There seems to be a few who do here...

In the Uk we cant be trusted with them you see......................... <br> <br>We are barely trusted with motor vehicles which is why there is a camera on almost every set of traffic lights, every few hundred yards on most roads and springing up on all of the motorway networks now. They are constantly decreasing the few mph of tolerence that these allow also. Any excess speed and there is a fine and penalty points in the mail. <br> <br>Our insurance, road tax and annual MOT inspection are all kept on computer so that we can be fined if we forget to renew them promptly. We are constantly under surveilence from CCTV cameras in every town centre and just in case they miss anybody. The police around here deploy more manpower than you see in most doughnut shops to set up road blocks to catch the few road tax evaders that are left. If they do they confiscate the car and crush it. Next year the tax on most family cars will almost double leading to more fines for late payment. <br> <br>Our government has already brainwashed the public into thinking that Drink Drivers are the anti christ and surreptitiously raised the fines and the cost of the retraining course, reissue of driving licence etc. They are doing the same with speeding and propose higher fines and points for anybody caught more than 20mph over the speed limit. Which pretty much outlaws motorcycling as I understand it. <br> <br>Of course nothing to do with the fact that Gormless Gordon has borrowed record amounts of money and is looking to recoup some, in his usual underhand way, from motorists <br> <br>The more I see of this country and the hypocritical lying b*stards that run it. In many ways it is a good thing they have taken our guns away.

Jeezus! <br> <br> Anyhow I had this friend named Rick Stut., he was a spindly little weasel but a great boxer, knocked out many with one punch. Then thare was another dude, his name was Mike Pars. Mike was a hard core hippy and loved people, really popular guy. <br> <br> These 2 people became very great friends. I knew them both and all was well, then they shared a house together as teenagers. In a drug deal gone bad Rick came over and asked me to go wit him and get his Harley back from mike, says he stoled it from him. <br> <br> I have always ran with some mean blokes, so I agreed to go get the bike back.... big mistake. I almost died that day with a DB shot gun shoved in my chest, cocked and loaded. I thought I was bullet proof. We took the bike that day and I lived to talk about it. Then come to find out the drug deal was part of the Harley. <br> <br> Today I get a phone call from mikes wife. We are all old now and time has past. They want to meet with me and make it all good. So if I die and the forum is without me. You will know I was trying to do the right thing and mend the old wounds. <br> <br>Wish me luck cos I may need it? and no... I wont be packin iron, I will take the slug and end it if that is in my cards. farewell friends it has been grand. funny how these things work out... today I found this in a car I had just bought... <br> <br><img src="http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg67/jehadjoe/100_2889.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>peace, <br>joe</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/wrebitup.svg" alt=wrebitup> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">wrebitup</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2008-11-21 00:39:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>When is this to happen Joe - I mean how many hours from now (or - + GMT)? <br> <br>Got me concerned </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TCsSD.svg" alt="TC's SD"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TC's SD</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2008-11-21 00:51:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>well Gary, heheh..Not quite sure on the time but joe is a force and normally I really do not worry about physical confrontations, it is easy for me no sweat.I have a few friends that have many bullet wounds as long as it passes without hitting any vital stuff. <br> <br> Really this is unavoidable and if the lord wants me I am ready. When I am in my right mind I preach love not war. I do not fight, and would rather take a beating than to give one. I have done this and really the pain is not all that bad. It always makes the opposition feel real bad cos they see they can not harm you. MC crashes... the bad ones are far worse and hope they do not want trouble. they will be calling me tomorrow.

Please allow me to illustrate?.. <br> <br>As a child the training was tough! <br> <br>then I was exposed to guns... right? better, bigger, faster with more precision and power? me thought... but strange new guns I had found.. <br> <br><img src="http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg67/jehadjoe/manwsrangegun.jpg" alt=Image>A growing coolection I had assembled!<img src="http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg67/jehadjoe/PropsKliWeaponCollection.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>After kicking stunning maiming and beatings with some carnage I did...(made me feel bad) so I sought out counseling.. <br> <br>and soon joe was accepted into the fold....OH joy <br> <br>Opps... may have done one small....... more harm than good? so I sought more counsel... <br> <br>and god lead me to Injun Jim, a very good and faithful friend to this day, his name be Humble and he did me... until I found tranquility.. heheh <br> <br>I was slowly figuring out... my short childhood had messed me up... <br> <br>I was as mean and radical as a crazed pup!( think I had parvo, cos I lived in a dog house outside with um!) <br> <br>soo.... I figured... hey! lets get back to nature? so I was an independent logger.. <br> <br> then I sought out more counsel and a little <span style="font-style: italic">serious</span> instruction, he knows how to cut the mustard! <img src="http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg67/jehadjoe/tiequanyerd00.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>and from him to this cali dude...<img src="http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg67/jehadjoe/schwartzwabigknife.jpg" alt=Image>one of my fav's<img src="http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg67/jehadjoe/dagger.jpg" alt=Image> <br> <br>and Big Toby in a finer moment of training..<img src="http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg67/jehadjoe/tobyingreece.jpg" alt=Image> some of the younger years... <img src="http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg67/jehadjoe/tobyfightingback.jpg" alt=Image>and my 2nd wife in a self defense class<img src="http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg67/jehadjoe/KillFace007.jpg" alt=Image> ...

I figured I would come here and practice her legacy.. <br> <br>Steve, <br> <br> <br> joe wants to say tanks, in this world of humble woah, I am but a flask of broken dreams throughout my life but I never expected even that. <br> <br>Head is hung so very low.. there seems to be no place left to go. So I sat down one summers night of long ago... <br> <br>Never typed, never wrote but I looked to play a game and thought...it would be the very same. <br> <br>To my surprise I found some mates?!? They made me feel god damned great! <br> <br>So this small joe... so very low, had found the place in which to go! <br> <br>Until that time had arose, joe ran on pumpkin far and wide. <br> <br>It was my place I chose to hide. <br> <br>For endless miles we danced, we played, <br> <br>away from this suffering which brought great pain. <br> <br>I sought to escape this place of woah.. <br> <br>and found the man who plays in snow! <br> <br>by one small joe, he likes bikes. <br> <br>that's all he actually really knows! <br> <br>one of these to go with a knife is always handy... but it will draw too much attention?... <br> <br>Word of the Day for Sunday, November 23, 2008 <br> <br>escutcheon \ih-SKUHCH-uhn\, noun: <br> <br>1. a shield decorated with a coat of arms <br>2. the protective metal
