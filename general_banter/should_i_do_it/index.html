He's spent a fair bit training me up time/money wise and i do appreciate it however...<br><br>My girlfriend and I have now split up after a 5 year relationship and so i've also moved back into my parents and im wondering if i should just follow my dream since ive started snowboarding....<br><br>Do a complete season in Canada. It would run from end of Nov to end of April. With my savings for my house I could manage to do it without having to work if i lived a student lifestyle. <br><br>Way i see it.<br><br>Pros<br>Is my dream to do a season (has been since i started)<br>Really wanna snowboard Canada at some point<br>I can afford to do it without working which would mean i could just bum around meet new people and snowboard all day for 5 months<br>No real close connections keeping me here at the moment (girlfriend, rent, morgage etc)<br>Its now or never i aint getting any younger<br>I could do a CASI course to maybe teach part time here which i think id love<br><br>Cons<br>When i get home id be buggered i'd have no savings but i would still have my SD and car (i think i can do it without selling these)<br>5 months is a long time and Canada seems a long way away from friends and family!<br>I dont know how to tell my dad after all the time and money hes spent on me im going to up and leave for 5 months.<br><br>I could do it in France but it would end up costing about the same and i couldn't do the instructor course and it wouldn't be Canada!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-08-03 08:23:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>your'e a long time dead.........end of story , you should already know the answer</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/shadowman.svg" alt=shadowman> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">shadowman</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-08-03 08:25:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>D-do it!

This is exciting but also a gamble, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.<br><br>Your dad would forgive you if you go I’m sure, whether he would re hire you if / when you get back is anybody’s guess.<br><br>Are you on the rebound? A relationship breakup can be a real big deal, the fact that they happen all the time does nothing to reduce the impact on you as an individual. Making big decisions on the back of a split up is almost always a mistake.<br><br>If you are OK after the split and especially if you can negotiate a season out with your dad so that you have something to come back to then it sounds perfect and the right time. If you are still reeling and think Canada is a solution then chances are you would be disappointed to find it isn’t and I would say stay, get your base sorted out and then go.

Memories will last a life time. I live not too far away from Tahoe California ski resorts and I always get jealous of the aussies who find jobs at the resorts for the winter because there is no surf in Oz during their summer. If I were you, I would consider California first. Can't beat massive snow dump one day, and the next bright sun so you can work on your tan as you bomb the double black diamonds in 10 feet of powder. <br><br>My favorite resort is Homewood. It's more of a locals only resort since its a bit further down the road from Squaw Valley, nice steep mountain great view of the lake. All of the tourist end up in Squaw or Heavenly, I avoid those resorts like the plague. Kirkwood has the best snow since it's the highest elevation. Sugar Bowl is also very good, but they got expensive the past few years. There are another 10-15 resorts scattered around the mountain. And then there is Mammoth mountain further south, with more awesome resorts. That mountain range just looks evil with its black obelisks, real trippy alien landscape.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MrZ32.svg" alt=MrZ32> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">MrZ32</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-08-04 08:07:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Well ultimately its up to you, and largely it depends if you can square things with your dad before you go.
