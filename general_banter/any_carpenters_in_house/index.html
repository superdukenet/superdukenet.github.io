Any thoughts?<br><br>Then there's the matter of keeping the bark on the outside surface. I like how it makes the table seem that much more "from nature" but it is quite rough and I think could get quite messy if applying mult coats to lacquer to it.

Lovely to see a bit of nature's best being preserved and used for its beauty eh. I am dead against wood chipping for furniture and stuff so take my hat off to you. I dont know much about what you need to do but I'd be concerned about how fast you remove the moisure as it can lead to splitting and that might be disasterous for you. I googled a bit and the science of timber drying is quite exacting.

This was a popular table top creation in the pot smokin sixties. Looks a little like a leaf too.<br>Dry slow. repeat dry slower. If it was outside for a tyme, you need to slowly take it back to +-fifteen percent moisture content. Leave on stickers so air will get around it and dry evenly.<br>I made a few of these and I used a boulder as a base and a poured sauno tube concrete base.<br>If you can get a cabinet shop to let you send it through their Timesaver belt sander you will save hours of time-hince the name. I say peel the bark and wire brush the bark to wood area and you will have a beautiful color combination for a border rather than a messy floor around said table.<br>You may find a nice trunk cut from a felled tree that makes a good base. A tree surgeon service will give you plenty of cut offs and will have their fellers cut you a nice square piece for a song.<br>Lots of these tops got poured on varithane finished that looked cheap and tacky.<br>You could easily get away with a Watco clear and a few good coats of furniture wax. <br>This may sound strange but do not rule out Bondo for your filler needs and can be stained to blend better rhan you realise.<br>Do not try to turn this into a work of art let its natural beauty shine through and KISS.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=cdlabate" alt=cdlabate> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">cdlabate</h3> <time datetime="2011-12-20 04:26:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-12-20 04:26:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>There's a place of Hwy 9 in the Bay area around Felton.

Also, filling the gap with epoxy and sealing it with varnish would stop any dimensional changes from moisture content over the years.
