Montgomery Assessor's report sent with letter of rejection to Laguna Motorcycles &amp; Black Horse Ltd. Mr. Blake failed to identify the report's lack of CPR compliance - NO STATEMENT OF TRUTH. Not until the hearing did I learn of this critical failing that has resulted in &gt;£25k total loss, £10k court order (that won't be paid) &amp; £4k outstanding finance amount Black Horse believe I owe them (recently slashed from £8k - again won't be paid. I won't re-enter the contract &amp; consent to fraud.) Laguna Motorcycle's debt collectors have visited twice but turned away.<br>2. My intention was to reject the motorcycle outright as the first tank had been replaced - the second still to my dissatisfaction thus defective.<br>3. Mr. Blake failed to execute his responsibility to provide duty of care &amp; advising an optimal course of action(s) to best protect my interests by implementing a strategy conducive to success in the small claims courts in order to enforce formal rejection of the motorcycle and seek full refund &amp; costs:<br><br>a) Retain possession of the motorcycle.<br>b) Acquire CPR complaint report.<br>c) Initiate small claims court action against Black Horse for breach of contract.<br>d) Deliver the motorcycle myself to court &amp; demonstrate the defective nature of the fuel tank - specifically internal degradation the excessive expansion of the fuel tank.<br>e) Succeed in small claims court.<br><br>4. Black Horse Ltd continuously insisted I made the collection arrangement safe in the knowledge that my report was not CPR compliant.<br>5. Believing that the letter of rejection &amp; the validity of Montgomery Assessor's report would be upheld I released the motorcycle GN12 FMD in good faith. AMS Motorcycles collected the motorcycle 8/1/2013, cementing my rejecting &amp; Black Horse's acceptance of rejection.<br><br>PROFESSIONAL NEGLIGENCE<br>SUBMITTING NON CPR COMPLIANT REPORT<br>DERELICTION OF DUTY<br>FAILURE IN DUTY OF CARE<br><br>PRACTICE DIRECTION 22 STATEMENT OF TRUTH:<br><br><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">David Kirwan, Kirwan's Solicitors</span></span><br><br>Mr. Kirwan's "services" were employed after the motorcycle had been collected by AMS Motorcycles Ltd.<br><br>1. Instructed me to collect the motorcycle from AMS Motorcycles Ltd after they falsified their report of the fuel tank's condition - I refused as I would be deemed to have accepted the change of fuel tank by AMS Motorcycles had I done so.<br>2. Failed to present the fact that Mr. Montgomery's report was not CPR compliant. (see above: PRACTICE DIRECTION 22 STATEMENT OF TRUTH)<br>3. Insisted on three day trial knowing that small claims court action had already commenced. Understandably this was dismissed. Had Mr. Kirwan invoked items <span style="font-weight: bold">9 &amp; 10</span> below (assuming the county court would honour the invocation of items 9 &amp;10) Mr. Lynn would have to have admitted prior to or capitulated at the hearing in light of his false representation of events.<br>4. Issue of "premium" - Sales of Goods Act does not discriminate between "new" &amp; "used" (within reason). Mr. Kirwan impeded progress in pursuit of establishing a wholly and irrelevant moot issue whilst I incurred the financial costs of his laggard strategy.<br>5. Further impeded progress on insisting that the matter was "complex" - not so:<br><br>A motorcycle's fuel tank is obviously one of the easiest components to access and is either:<br><br>a) Chemically resistant - thus remains inert.<br>b) Not chemically resistant - thus demonstrates adverse reaction.<br><br>A fuel tank is either:<br><br>a) Dimensionally stable - thus within dimensional tolerance.<br>b) Not dimensionally stable - thus exceeds dimensional tolerance.<br><br>6. Insisted Burden of Proof was on me. Sales of Goods Act deems this to be not the case (see below under "additional").<br>7. The following link was brought Mr. Kirwan's attention, he assured me there was nothing untoward to be concerned about:<br><br><br><br>8. Applied injunction against AMS Motorcycles Ltd but failed to invoke the following <span style="font-weight: bold">critical</span> legal protocols (&amp; arguably foundational legal formalities) <span style="font-style: italic">immediately after</span> Mr. Lynn was appointed by Nadeem Khan.<br><br>9. <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Abuse of process &amp; failure to obtain potentially material evidence &amp; principles:</span></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">Please note: The motorcycle is a KTM 990 Superduke R and the "inspection" was conducted on biased ground at KTM Sportmotorcycle UK, Northamptonshire</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Lamont, R. v [2010] EWCA Crim 2144<br><br>The principles for determining whether a trial should be stayed for abuse of process where there is a failure to obtain potentially material evidence are now well established. The relevant principles were laid down in the leading authority of R (Ebrahim) v Feltham Magistrates' Court [2001] 1 WLR 1293. Although that was a Divisional Court case, the principles there enunciated have since been applied in this court in cases such as R v Medway [2000] Crim LR 415 and R v Dobson [2001] EWCA Crim 1606.<br><br>In determining whether there is a stay, the principles can be stated as follows:<br><br>(1) Was the prosecution in breach of a duty in failing to obtain evidence? In determining that question regard should be had to the Code of Practice applicable to prosecuting authorities and the Attorney General's guidelines. If there is no breach of duty, then the question of stay will not arise.<br>(2) If the prosecution is in breach of duty, have they acted in bad faith or otherwise in serious default of their duty? If so, then the prosecution should be stayed on that ground alone, irrespective of whether a fair trial would be possible. In these very exceptional cases it is not so much that the defendant cannot receive a fair trial but that it would be unfair to subject him to a trial at all.<br>(3) Absent bad faith or serious default, there should only be a stay if there is such serious prejudice to the defendant that a fair trial cannot be guaranteed.<br>(4) In most cases, the difficulty arising from the lack of evidence can be dealt with by an appropriate direction in the trial process itself. It is only in exceptional circumstances that a stay is likely to be appropriate.<br>In this context it is important to bear in mind two points which were emphasised by this court in Ebrahim. First, the discretionary power to ensure fairness means fairness to both the defendant and to the prosecution. It is important that the guilty are convicted as well as the innocent acquitted. Second, there will frequently be holes in the prosecution case which may result from some failing by the prosecution. Typically, for example, it may be a failure to recover CCTV material which would have been available had steps been taken at the appropriate time. In giving the judgment of the court Brookes LJ said:<br><br>"27. .... If, in such a case, there is sufficient credible evidence, apart from the missing evidence, which, if believed, would justify a safe conviction, then a trial should proceed, leaving the defendant to seek to persuade the jury or justices not to convict because evidence which might otherwise have been available was not before the court through no fault of his. Often the absence of [relevant evidence] is likely to hamper the prosecution as much as the defence."</span><br><br>10. Failed to invoke Witness Summonsing of Mr. Lynn prior to hearing.<br><br>11. CFA first dependent of "quantum".<br><br>12. CFA later became dependent on favourable report.<br><br>13. Possible collusion with ACE Assessors (see below.)<br><br>All parties assumed I was relying solely on Mr Montgomery's report - unaware I had detailed photographs taken by myself of the fuel tank's defect (confirmed by date &amp; time). Mr. Kirwan's failure to inform me of the absence of CPR compliance re. Mr Montgomery report, destroyed the distinct advantage I had of visiting AMS Motorcycles (post official rejection) so as to photograph the interior of the tank they replaced without my consent. Mr. Blake &amp; Mr. Kirwan are responsible for their respective failures regarding Duty of Care &amp; Dereliction of Duty towards their client in what amounted to a polarised ambush on the day of the hearing.<br><br>PROFESSIONAL NEGLIGENCE<br>DERELICTION OF DUTY<br>FAILURE IN DUTY OF CARE<br>GROSS OVERCHARGING<br><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Andrew Montgomery, Montgomery Assessors</span></span><br><br>Report: <br><br>1.

AMS Motorcycles Ltd were previously uncooperative to rectify their incorrect installation of the second tank (I was instructed via email by AMS Motorcycles Ltd to use KTM's recovery service to collect the motorcycle in order for AMS Motorcycles Ltd to rectify their fault).<br>2. AMS Motorcycles Ltd's motive changed once motorcycle had been formally rejected i.e., the motorcycle was collected in a prompt &amp; punctual fashion by AMS Motorcycles Ltd.<br>3. AMS Motorcycles Ltd's premises is a modest, double floor commercial unit - space is at a premium. <br>4. The "inspection" AMS Motorcycles Ltd performed was free of charge.<br>5. AMS Motorcycles Ltd are a business but spent 2 weeks (8/1/2013 - 23/1/2013) to perform an inspection that should've taken no longer than 60 minutes whilst generating no revenue from the inspection.<br>6. AMS Motorcycles Ltd's prioritised interest was to inspect the motorcycle at their earliest convenience in order to convey their findings &amp; solicit the collection of the motorcycle in order to replace it with a motorcycle that would have served to generate revenue for the business - due to weather/riding constraints: seasonally, winter time is the time of year motorcycle shops (the repair side of the business) are at their busiest. <br>7. AMS Motorcycles' sent 3 storage charges after I had advised them that the motorcycle had been rejected &amp; that I would not be accepting return of the motorcycle (storage charges not paid.)<br>8. I was invited to KTM Sportmotorcycle UK Ltd to inspect freestanding tank (irrelevant as tank was replaced due to expansion) but prejudicially ordered not to attend the formal inspection for fear that I would have identified that the fuel tank was replaced by AMS Motorcycles Ltd whilst the motorcycle was in their possession.<br>9. In reference to the above &amp; due to my previous (confrontational) interaction with AMS Motorcycles Ltd, they knew that my grievance was with the <span style="font-style: italic">inherently defective nature</span> of 990 Superduke fuel tanks &amp; <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span>as an isolated case. This did little to stifle their motive towards unlawfully replacing the fuel tank. If AMS Motorcycles Ltd had been instructed by Robert Quinton of Black Horse Ltd to replace the fuel tank, they were in breach of duty of care &amp; the law to inform me of this instruction.<br>10. Breach of Injunction.<br><br><br>FRAUD BY FALSE REPRESENTATION<br>BREACH OF INJUNCTION<br>TAMPERING WITH MATERIAL EVIDENCE<br>CONTEMPT<br>PERVERTING THE COURSE OF JUSTICE<br><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Philip Mark Lynn, A.C.E Assessors Ltd</span></span><br><br>Report: <br><br>1.

Price of inspection tripled but distance to inspection reduced significantly. The motorcycle was unlawfully moved from AMS Motorcycles Ltd, Tewkesbury (in breach of injunction) to KTM Sportmotorcycle UK Ltd, Northampton.<br>3. Concealed photography of tank's interior (detailed below.)<br>4. Neglected to prove fuel content to support claim that "no leaks were present" (detailed below.)<br>5. Omitted lower bush deliberately to conceal the fact that the fuel tank had exceeded it dimensional tolerance (detailed below.)<br>6. Mr. Lynn stated the bolt was easily wound by hand. Note - front fuel tank mounting bolt is non-knurled M8x40mm socket head cap screw.<br>7. Upon insertion, the bolt head barely stands proud above the aluminium collar &amp; bolt head is without knurls. Mr. Lynn would have to have demonstrated a vice like grip &amp; dexterity of a child <span style="font-weight: bold">and simultaneously compress the fuel tank sufficiently</span> to have achieved this claim. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Cross refer photos 9.13 &amp; 9.14 in ACE Assessors report above &amp; personal comparison below - the tank had retracted by several millimetres after bolt reinstallation asserting the fact that Mr. Lynn must have used a robust tool to install &amp; cross thread the bolt - undeniably proving Mr Lynn's claim is without question: <span style="font-weight: bold">falsified</span>.</span><br>Front fuel tank mounting bolt, item #15:<br><br><br><br>8. Cross threaded bolt due to tank expansion. With no flash from the camera, the angle was chosen specifically so that the tank's shadow would mask the gap between the lower rubber bush &amp; the chassis mounting plate. (detailed below.)<br>9. Tank had retracted considerably between unfastened photo/refastened photo &amp; evidence proves the bolt had been under load when forcibly installed.<br>10. Heat soak causing further expansion of the fuel tank could lead additional load to the bolt causing it to bend &amp; permitting fuel tank/steering assembly interference.<br>11. Vibrational fatigue (thru insufficient bolt tension) may result in future bolt failure, the result is self explanatory. <br>12. Sequestered inspection conducted at KTM Sportmotorcycle UK Ltd - I was not aware AMS Motorcycles Ltd had transferred the motorcycle 5 months previously until the time of inspection.<br>13. I was not permitted to be present at the inspection by order of Nadeem Khan &amp; reinforced by A.C.E Assessors. I was therefore not privy to any discussion between Mr. Lynn of A.C.E Assessors Ltd &amp; Mr. Tiller of KTM Sportmotorcycle UK Ltd. My absence entitled Mr Lynn the freedom to falsify his report.<br>14. Inspection date brought forward without formal notification to myself.<br>15. I expected Mr. Lynn to perform in a professional capacity, not to conceal the fact the tank was an imposter. My own photography proves that Mr. Lynn's report was manufactured under fraudulent pretence &amp; amounts to nothing more than a litany of lies with sole intent to defraud the legal process.<br><br>Instructions to SJE via David Kirwan of Kirwan's Solicitors:<br><br><br><br>Email from David Kirwan regarding instructions to SJE.

Yellow line MUST be either:<br>a) In parity with the white line<br>b) OR behind the white line – NOT IN FRONT.<br>4. Mounting assembly (lower rubber bush) cannot be displaced rearward any further to align with bolt hole.<br>5. Bolt cannot be installed due to excessive growth of fuel tank, as evidence by the eccentric rubber bush/bolt hole relationship.<br> <br><br>Photo 1.02 Notes:<br>1. No visible gap between front mount &amp; headstock – confirming identical level of expansion as per photo 1.01.<br>2. Mounting assembly (lower rubber bush) deliberately omitted to eliminate valid point of reference of expansion.<br>3. IDENTICAL level of expansion as per photo 1.01, thus bolt could not have been installed due to excessive growth, contrary to Mr. Lynn’s fraudulent claim.<br>4. Taken from A.C.E Assessor's report: <span style="font-style: italic">5.2 There was no evidence of distortion, insecurity, misalignment, fouling of other components, leaks, damage, <span style="font-weight: bold">swelling</span> or other issues present with the fuel tank and its installation on the motorcycle.</span><br><br><br>Photo 1.03 Notes:<br>1.

Visible gap between front mount &amp; headstock demonstrating partial compression of excessively expanded fuel tank.<br><br><br>Photo 1.04 Notes:<br>1. Mr Lynn’s instruction was to take the photograph from the side of the motorcycle – not from an oblique angle whereby it must be assumed that Mr Lynn has attempted to incorporate the shadow of the fuel tank’s overhang in order mask the fact that the mounting assembly has been incorrectly installed.<br>2. The bolt is approaching the vertical - the chassis plate is in decline therefore the bolt is cross threaded, not seated fully nor correctly - and couldn’t possibly have been started by hand without pre-compression of the fuel tank. Assuming this photo was taken after the tank was first unfastened as no proof exists that this is the case.<br>3.

In doing this, they had acted in a manner inconsistent with Mr Bowes' ownership, thereby accepting that the car had been rejected.

Doing so, I would have re-entered myself into the contract. Had I returned the motorcycle to Laguna Motorcycles myself, the outcome would have been the same (this would have been unreasonable - Laguna Motorcycles Ltd ignored my emails, they received my letter of rejection &amp; I was not prepared to deliver the motorcycle from Worcestershire to Kent at my own expense): my rejection wouldn't have been accepted, the tank replaced <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">again</span></span> &amp; consequently a brand new tank would have been inspected. If I had taken return of the motorcycle, my 6 month passage of time would have elapsed &amp; (at the time I believed) my right to reject would have evaporated. I would also have accepted return of goods (specifically: the replaced fuel tank) thus accepted the change of fuel tank. I did not buckle to the increasingly intimidating storage charges sent by AMS Motorcycles Ltd. My ultimatum to Black Horse that I wouldn't accept the motorcycle back if it were to be collected preliminarily cemented my rejection &amp; Black Horse's acceptance of my rejection. Threatening Black Horse under the Fraud 2006 Act obviously did not deter the motives implemented in order to quash my rejection under fraudulent &amp; criminal pretences.<br><br>The absence of CPR compliance in respect to Mr. Montgomery's report was deliberately supressed by Black Horse Ltd. No application was made to strike out Mr. Montgomery's report on behalf of Black Horse (or my defence for that matter), as such I walked, unsuspectingly into an ambush. Efforts were made to guarantee I didn't bare witness to the replaced fuel tank fitted by AMS Motorcycles Ltd &amp; that a misleading report be manufactured to occult the illegitimacy of AMS Motorcycles' actions.<br><br>AMS Motorcycles Ltd's representation of events was an outright lie, Mr. Lynn's report on behalf of ACE Assessors was manufactured &amp; contains nothing but fabricated, fraudulent evidence. Mr. Lynn abused his responsibility to act with impartiality &amp; honesty whom ignored simple instructions, tampered with the mounting assembly (lower bush omission), supplied misleading photos, cross threaded a bolt - alleging it was wound easily by hand &amp; suppressed the meta data conducive to establishing the chronology of the photography in order to provide a misleading report. It's totally unsurprising that (given that I am best qualified to cast judgement on the situation) I was blocked at all levels from attending the inspection as I would have identified the imposter fuel tank fitted by AMS Motorcycles Ltd instantly &amp; Mr. Lynn would have been rendered incapable of (allegedly) refastening the fuel tank bolt by hand under my strict supervision because the task is physically impossible. Mr. Lynn cannot disprove my allegations without recreating his interactions in the interests of defending his version of events. Mr. Lynn will not oblige to re-enact his inspection as he has claimed to achieve a feat that is in actuality, physically impossible thus Mr. Lynn cannot claim professional negligence based on these grounds alone.<br><br><br>The motorcycle is still in circulation:<br>2011 KTM 990 Superduke R<br>VRM: GN12 FMD<br><br><br><br>The decision of Nadeem Khan hinged solely on the sentence “tank is fit for purpose” that stemmed from a <span style="text-decoration: underline">manufactured</span> report that recklessly attempted to disguise the fact that the tank inspected was an imposter &amp; also defective. Nadeem Khan operated a sequestered hearing - barring witness presence &amp; appointed a dishonest person whom obfuscated facts critical to determining a valid representation of the facts, exonerating those guilty of criminal conduct whilst abusing the rights of litigants in person. Nadeem Khan exploited my right to self representation (as I could no longer afford legal representation) - blatantly took the reigns &amp; guided the hearing in Black Horse's favour which includes events prior to the hearing itself. Namely selecting Mr Philip Lynn of ACE Assessors whom had refrained from impartiality &amp; operated fully in a deceptive manner favouring the position of Black Horse &amp; KTM Sportmotorcycle. Nadeem Khan rejected my request to bring forth my witnesses simply to prevent 3rd party witness to a phoney court session. They expected me to acknowledge Mr. Lynn's manufactured report as fact which I had proven to be fraudulent.<br><br>Black Horse defaulted my credit rating 15th May 2013 – I did <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> default on the agreement, the fuel tank was defective thus the motorcycle was legitimately rejected.

Furthermore Laguna Motorcycles have attempted (via debt collectors) to recover legal costs via debt collectors purporting to be "High Court Enforcement". This amounts to attempted burglary (2 x counts of).<br><br>By releasing the motorcycle in good faith &amp; trusting AMS Motorcycles to behave in a professional capacity, I have exposed myself to multiple acts of unlawful conduct on the part of AMS Motorcycles &amp; ACE Assessors. My personal photography proves irrefutably that the fuel tank's base material demonstrated an inherently adverse &amp; unacceptable reaction to the fuel. Moreover, the difference in moulding inconsistency can be determined from ACE Assessor's internal tank photo &amp; confirms fully that AMS Motorcycles replaced the tank while the motorcycle was in their possession between January 8th - January 23rd 2013. The fuel tank fitted had evidently expanded beyond its design parameter &amp; Mr Lynn falsified his statement in claiming he refastened the fuel tank bolt easily by hand additionally stating that no signs of swelling were present - proven to be patently false.<br><br>When prosecuting, I will pursue the invocation of Mr. Lynn undertaking a polygraph in the event that the material evidence had been destroyed: <br><br><br><br>Bernie Tiller @ KTM UK on 01280 709 500. Inform him that your 990 Superduke fuel tank has expanded &amp; that it will no longer fit. You'll either be told this is "due to a blocked breather" (rigid plastic fuel tanks DO NOT inflate like balloons) or "It sounds as though someone removed the fuel tank when the engine's still hot." I reiterate: this statement is submission of the fact that the fuel tanks when exposed to thermal heat soak expand beyond their design parameters &amp; are therefore defective in nature.<br><br>KTM have issued a recall for suspected compromised threaded inserts on the polymer tanks fitted to their 2014 1290 Superduke. Reported leaks have occurred due to this defect. I had expected KTM to have benefitted from my research efforts thereby selecting an improved PA6 Nylon compound for their 1290 Superduke fuel tanks &amp; yet they failed to do so:<br><br></div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=ColonelKlinck" alt=Colonel_Klinck> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Colonel_Klinck</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2014-05-11 19:29:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2014-05-11 19:29:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Ouch!

Any UK law students out there that can help you with some research if you do decide to go forward?

It is totally understandable that this has become an emotional issue, but I hope you are able to separate your emotional involvement from the objective mindset that you need to examine these issues.

Is it worth an appeal? <br><br>Best of luck in whatever you decide. I'm sure that friends, family, and legal counsel have asked you to "let it go, it's just a motorcycle."

I was already aware of the Ducati settlement (which is self explanatory) at that time hence the letter stipulated that the motorcycle had been rejected in its entirety because of the unsatisfactory quality of the fuel tank(s).<br><br>Black Horse called requesting that the motorcycle be taken away &amp; inspected by KTM. As the 1st tank had been replaced (incorrectly &amp; returned for rectification) it was established that the motorcycle again go to AMS Motorcycles (AMS only 10 miles away). I challenged Black Horse as to why the motorcycle couldn't be inspected on my premises &amp; why it was <span style="font-style: italic">myself</span> who was expected to make the collection arrangements. Black Horse insisted KTM inspect the bike but avoided addressing the issue of retention &amp; inspection under my supervision.<br><br>Smelling a rat, I wrote to Black Horse requesting they seek <span style="font-style: italic">my</span> permission in writing to release the motorcycle. I did this to absolve myself from any implication that I was prepared to release &amp; have the motorcycle inspected by my own free will. In the same letter, Black Horse were also advised that the motorcycle wouldn't be accepted back regardless of verdict due to suspicion that the tank would be changed <span style="font-style: italic">again</span>. I stated in no uncertain terms that my rejection was final. Black Horse obliged by requesting permission in writing from myself to permit the release of the motorcycle.<br><br>Note: Other than dehydration to shrink the tank, the bubbles wouldn't disappear by reversion alone. It would have to be replaced to eliminate the internal degradation. The motorcycle was brand new &amp; I was obliged by way of PCP Hire Purchase Agreement that the motorcycle's maintentnance schedule be adhered to. I was not prepared to pay for the protocol whereby the tank <span style="font-style: italic">must</span> be forced into placed after removal.<br><br>I made the collection arrangements. AMS representative remarked at time of collection that they would “fix” it. I retorted that the motorcycle had been rejected.<br><br>2 weeks later, AMS called several times to advise collection, I told them that the bike had been rejected. AMS stated in writing that I could not reject the motorcycle to them. Opposing counsel made no point that I hadn't returned the motorcycle to Laguna myself nor had I deemed acceptance by way of repair or replacement.<br><br>Laguna failed to act on my intent to reject. They ignored all three emails although I received return receipts that they had been read. The 1st email complained about the growth beyond design limit (with photo).The 2nd email to Laguna proposed that a new tank be treated with Caswell. Caswell treatment hasn't proven to be 100% successful &amp; in the event of failure would annul the mechanical warranty.<br><br>At this point in time the decisions I took were with the express intent to prevent exposing myself to the possibility that I had deemed acceptance by way of repair or replacement &amp; to annul any implied personal desire to have the motorcycle removed by way of my own free will. I ensured Black Horse requested my permission in writing to release the motorcycle. I was happy at that time to allow the collection as this would enforce my rejection in principle as I no longer retained possession of the motorcycle.<br><br>The return of the motorcycle to the vendor themselves (Laguna), arguably is factually incorrect. My contract of PCP Hire Purchase Agreement was with Black Horse Ltd – not Laguna Motorcycles. Both parties were informed of my intent to reject the motorcycle in its entirety. The return of the motorcycle to Laguna is uncontroversial. Distance selling regulations would argue it was not my responsibility after intimating rejection that I be the one responsible for return. This would have necessitated van hire for the 380 mile round trip plus diesel at my cost &amp; thus be wholly unreasonable.<br><br>The report received from Black Horse on behalf of AMS stated no issues were found with the tank.<br><br>Had I requested the motorcycle be inspected <span style="font-style: italic">only</span> &amp; stipulate that no repair nor replacement be conducted, the collection of the motorcycle after inspection by myself would have placed the Burden of Proof upon myself to prove the tank was changed before proving any defect had in actuality existed. No request was made by myself as the motorcycle was rejected <span style="font-weight: bold">outright in its entirety</span> thus reversing the Burden of Proof. Had I collected the motorcycle (as per my 2nd solicitor's proposal over the phone which I rejected instantly) I would have been deemed to have accepted the goods irrespective of what actions AMS may or may not have executed. This is precisely why I comissioned a 3rd party inspection before the motorcycle was formally rejected &amp; collected. Consequently the 3rd party inspection report was not CPR compliant as I learned to my detriment in the hearing itself. Neither solicitors had informed me of this. Had I retaken possession as described in this paragraph I would have been buggered by default by accepting the goods.<br><br>As you can hopefully appreciate, I took all precautionary steps to guarantee my rejection was water tight. Note: If the problem arises within the 1st six months it was taken as being present at time of purchase &amp; 5 months had already elapsed. The Queen's speech: Bill of Rights proposes entitlement to provide 1 x opportunity <span style="font-style: italic">only</span> to rectify/repair. I had provided KTM the opportunity to correct the issue – both tanks were not of satisfactory quality nor free from minor defects. No arguments brought by opposing counsels that 3 x opportunities must be provided to correct/rectify the problem. The motorcycle wasn't inspected before the deposit was paid nor until after the contract had been signed. The first time I saw the motorcycle was at handover. <span style="font-weight: bold">There's no reason for a reasonable person to expect manifestation of manufacturing defects with a brand new vehicle at the time of hand over.</span><br><br>Opposing counsel had no need to cite principles of acceptance in the Sales &amp; Supply of Goods Act as I don't doubt they were aware of the instigation of the bogus report.<br><br>AMS had no contractural obligation to enter proceedings but I believe they replaced the tank, falsified their report &amp; breached their injunction.<br><br>This is why I feel I have grounds to pursue appeal &amp; bring civil/criminal charges against AMS for replacing the tank* (perverting the course of justice) &amp; breach of injunction (contempt of Court). KTM UK obliged acceptance of the motorcycle's storage thereby qualifying their complicit behaviour in proceedings.<br><br>*The presence of the rubber bush is vital &amp; most certainly common sense to determine tank growth. I believe the omission of the bush by the SJE was deliberate in order to provide a misleading verdict. The interior was confirmed not to have the bubbling on the surface of which the Judge tried &amp; failed to imply directly were present in the fuel itself.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">The rejection process is a paradox: How can an individual reject goods if the only absolute to prevent susceptibility of falling foul of corruption/illegality/incompetence is through retention of the very item you're rejecting, ultimately to enforce rescission of contract?!?!?!?!?!?</span></span><br><br>The above can be interpreted as a loophole, opening up the possibility of abuse to the rights of the consumer &amp; must be addressed at the highest level.<br><br>I trusted both solicitors. The 1st was reactive &amp; passive. The 2nd was made aware of vehicle rejection case studies from the first instance &amp; I feel he was simply pushing his own agenda. I've had to figure this out for myself.<br><br>I hope this clarifies both my position &amp; my understanding of the law.<br><br>Leeroybrown:<br><br>You've missed my point somewhat. The bike was brand new, it had to undergo compulsory servicing. The tanks I had witnessed <span style="font-style: italic">had</span> to be forced into place. Depending on locality, the tanks themselves prove not be compatible with the recommended fuel type (Sticker on 1st tank stated RON 95 Unleaded) in terms of expansion &amp; internal degredation (in my case at least).<br><br>You ask will they leak? I speculated in my research thread that KTM may now employ integral steel reinforcing brackets for the fuel pump &amp; rear mounts (akin to Elkamet method). Strategic stiffening will only serve to redirect expansion loads to weaker areas of the tank. Fuel level sender orifice: although smaller than the fuel pump flange &amp; not structural, are these reinforced also &amp; in time, impervious to warping?<br><br>The motorcycle I acquired was not fitted with the support ram, eliminating the stresses imparted on the inserts as a result. Has anyone else noticed that the 1290 tank is a slide on affair &amp; is no longer a hinged/semi rigid design with support ram? Eliminating the cost of the ram could be argued but doesn't detract from the fact that the configuration has been totally overhauled.<br><br>Do they function as a fuel tank? Fuel tanks are not interference fit components &amp; I would prefer not to find out the hard way <span style="font-style: italic">if</span> the tank(s) were to leak. My inauguration into engineering was in machining &amp; helicopter maintenance. I don't condone the material specification/method of manufacture for the final product to be deemed as adequate, free from minor defects, of reasonable quality &amp; fit for purpose for the role it's intended to serve. Additionally, Ducati, BMW &amp; MotoGuzzi have lost faith in the polyamide fuel tank &amp; as such are reverting back to metal tanks.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">“The new tank brings with it a superior metal construction that allows for a lighter tank along with a greater fuel capacity.”</span> Again, I have already argued the twofold benefits of increased material integrity &amp; increased capacity by use of metal in construction.<br><br><br><br>You are all (or should be) already aware that the 2014 RC390 is supplied with a steel tank.<br><br>If proactivity is a crime, I'm guilty as charged.

If somebody with proper knowledge is offering genuine insight into your situation this is infinitely more valuable to you than any number of sympathisers or well-wishers offering moral support.
