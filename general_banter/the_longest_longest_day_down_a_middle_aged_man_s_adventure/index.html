Its too light, I'm  too uptight. At 3 am I give up and go have a shower. I glug a bottle of water and drag all my crap out to the unsuspecting poor old bike through the grey pre-dawn light and drizzle. The bike fires up on the second attempt only, this does not bode well...<br><br><img src="https://9slyxq.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pnvOwazz9Od_EMIx3YrhRY4TKkIGU4PSnO0q_DnG-KPAxM-jQhj0pIzNBvryfCTkTdY7XRv_i4OoaK4xrgsXAFhKsmnGaw7kX0FHQmHV2zWc/WP_20140620_014.jpg" alt=Image><br><br> <br>Anyway, myself and the Battlestar Galacticrap cough and splutter our way down to the start point. Most folk are here already, as well as some other bunch of guys doing the same thing! I need to chill the fook out, but I hate riding in the rain, i hate riding in big groups. I decide to hang near the back (this turns out to be my default position for the event :biggrinvk4:  ) when we get waved off.<br><br><img src="https://9slyxq.blu.livefilestore.com/y2p18PlmOSTbWx7RPgq3FTiTs6vmwucGkwYRRQLQ__LBfIsGaY_ZqL34rlKn6zano7dJVKIodJ51WHK9lqe4fPNLStVl3Q3jrGfxcFCD_SQHHk/GOPR0045.JPG" alt=Image><br><br><img src="https://9slyxq.blu.livefilestore.com/y2p3gDDz-VJzjw_PoU9Nrbs3AlwVt9Eabnf_hKW45msMdn5YfZ6vaNxZZTmv38XcaqgU_Lz8dUt5wkADl7CQw6XGpXktK4TwUoSL1PHfz8PDpA/GOPR0061.JPG" alt=Image><br> <br>This is it, 6 months or more of prepping and bodging the bike, keep it together now. The bike is running rough, it keeps bogging down then surging forwards unexpectedly. fook! I'm panic braking into corners because the bike keeps running on, my confidence is shot and I'm annoyed at myself for not fitting the carb refurb kit I got a few weeks previously. Ah well, MTFU time, carry on regardless. Next stop Inverness for me, I know the bike can do it I decide to try and relax, let the bike take the strain and enjoy the scenery, after all, I'm in the North East of Scotland, its stunning up here. Sometimes I forget all of this is only a few hours from my door step<br><br><img src="https://9slyxq.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pTfmsre07WmK3Hjk7yQz3g_6T73Lh7dlIxEj3kh-lfm8Z0BGr1JPuoMbe4SmhlKv5Mjc9WzHQq3wcHDlNtYV4KFIGYEEtH54GcNdOSWPqQSw/GOPR0150.JPG" alt=Image><br><br> <br>Eventually I catch up to  the scooter and Jez on the 125 cruise-control  and pass them. The roads open up and the fluffinees is less of an issue with fewer tight turns, so I wind it on a bit and roll on through the Dornoch Firth and on down into Inverness.<br> <br>I pull into the Tesco on the far side of town, only to see Rich on the NTV. We stop for a blether, a quick drink and snack and we're on our way again.<br><br><img src="https://9slyxq.blu.livefilestore.com/y2piqrMcjeu8gcoR_omc68_48UAjlF6xR2hvBIa9Fp6d3SZuBAfJb-lwKg3OFMV1o8Kv-l16nQJ25aW3leFy6VePVUPeIdFQ0OW1m6odnxwAS8/GOPR0355.JPG" alt=Image><br> <br>As we get further south, the weather improves and we can make some progress. Well we do until my jerry can escacpes from its bungee along the A9 and bursts, throwing 95 octane everywhere. I do the environmental thing and fling it into the bushes  :ph34r: .<br> <br>It is a little while from here that we see Smobytoe jumping around like a loony, it fair perks me up and I'm laughing into my lid while bopping along to ZZ Top on the Bluetooth ( I like them ok, shut up you at the back).<br> <br>We're doing ok and since I'm the local I'm on navigational duties until we hit Engerland. Naturally I turn too early for the A823 (about 50m too early and we have to turn around again). Aah the A823, or the Rumbling Bridge road as us locals call it. It used to be a stonking road, but the surface has crumbled in parts, luckily there are still some good bits here and there. A quick photo opportunity at Knockhill and the into Dunfermline and Rosyth, where due to being on the phone to my Mrs, I missed another turn and we had to double back on ourselves again. So much for local knowledge.<br><br><img src="https://9slyxq.blu.livefilestore.com/y2poo1Amu68Fxj5y502MPrFxF48y83laQJM2qlkZ2JqcxlDnl4FbpA_MlQ9pAFddXHi0zm0tV8fYRAA-Rtr1hKgp4o2ztwuM4YQR-I2c1SKYKs/WP_20140621_001.jpg" alt=Image><br><br>We scoot over the bridge where my Mrs, her folks and my son are waiting. Jez is just readying to leave as we arrive. Looking in a hurry as he has been accosted by my father-in-law. We have a wee chat, quick nibble, half a cup of coffee, then off to brim up.<br><br><br>Quick blast around the bypass, onto the A68 and its roadworks. Its at one of these temporary lights that Rich tells me my bike has been smoking. We pull over at the next layby, and there is nothing showing in the oil sight glass. One of the sag wagons turns up(someone remind me who was in each, My mind is blurred) I endure comments about Scots being exposed to the sun etc, while pouring 3/4 litre of Halfords finest into the big Yamaha.<br><br>Topped up, we up our pace a little over the swooping curves of what used to be s brilliant biking/driving road before it was cluster-bombed with cameras.<br><br>We make the border, get some pics, the sag wagon appears again, as does Johnny McAvoy (PB journalsit and organiser). We must be running pretty far behind if the big chap is here I think.<br><br><br><img src="https://9slyxq.blu.livefilestore.com/y2p2yKtElbAWk-0Clm-fx22qTa97WqsOuiI3p91uOqd8QjodZVUAJIJQ2r8HpLGEDqOS-Klo9NrEfw7qRytt-A7bIIHdEyF6n3caXYmHM6cEYM/WP_20140621_005.jpg" alt=Image><br><br><br>We head off again, Rich in the lead this time...</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/jaycee.svg" alt=jaycee> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">jaycee</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-06-29 00:45:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>And so the saga continues...<br><br>Rich heads straight off down the steep hills into the English side of the A68 (better surfaced than this side BTW) and immediately the pace picks up. Its warm and sunny, this part of the A68 is like a roller coaster and I'm on an adventure. I feel fooking fantastic at this point. Rich is navigating so I just switch to follow-mode.<br><br>I get a phonecall on the bluetooth from a mate who thinks its hilarious that he's speaking to me while I'm doing 90 throught the Yorkshire Dales. I do to come to think if it. He wishes me well (he donated £20) and rings off. <br><br>I love this part of the country, its just utterly beautiful. Although I do have to admit that every time I am down that way the Postman Pat theme pops into my head ( and won't fooking go away!). I think it may be that when I rode my Bandit to the PB 90's trackday at Cadwell in September 08 I nearly got flattened by a Post Offcie van...<br><br>Anyway, back to the action. I can see that Rich is itching to pull the trigger, but I just can't seem to ride faster than I currently am. I'm now aware of the bike's thirst for oil and I'm reluctant to rev it too hard. So I just admire the scenery as we roll on by at 80-90.<br><br>Finally we reach Darlington, fill up, have a drink and a wee snack. Then we head off, fruitlessly it turns out, in search of the next part of the route. The junction we wanted to take was closed for roadworks, the diversion had a diversion. We turned back to Darlington and saw John(??) on the big scooter in a layby. We pull over for a chat about where to go and the Galaxy arrives. After some discussion, and a call to JM, it is decided that we will follow the Galaxy down the A1 (NOT motorway apparently, but boring as fook nonethless) for a few junctions and the npick up the route again. It is during this stint that the scooter dies for good. Poor bloke.<br><br>We gain the route again after a wee while and go in search of the pit-stop caravan. We finally find it, but come from the wrong direction. Anyway, we pull in and get given a very welcome cuppa and a ham sandwich. never, ever, has white bread with ham on it tasted so goddam good! The XJ gets roughly a gallon of oil added ( ok half a litre) and we head off again.<br><br><img src="https://9slyxq.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pSPmneEhbfFGLHQstToevsgFecQ2G3igRVn0GNNbeurY3XsG8pJbTe37KohmMX2VN9H4ScYkx6UiFXCoy5tyj-KeUU_MUfYO3_xpoIZ3fNNE/WP_20140621_008.jpg" alt=Image><br><br>Rich is heading off to see a mate, but says he will catch up again. he indicates to me where to head, but immediately I get flustered. I find a services where there are a pair of Traffic Officers and explain my predicament. They are very interested, and frankly impressed by our bravery/stupidity, by the whole LDD. After they give me pointers to get back on the route, one of them gives me £5 to put in the pot! I thank them both, shake their hands and say ( with an inwards chuckle) "Thanks GENTS" <br><br><br>Many of the participants had a much easier time than I did. It will be run again next year, Johnny McAvoy form Performance Bikes hopes to run it again, but he wants t oget a much wider audience and thusly a much larger fund raised to donate to Cancer Research.<br><br>If anybody wants to do next year's run, let me know. Once the ball start rolling I can get you in touch with Johnny. 21 particiapnts this year, we reckon an absolute max of 35-40 to be workable. <br><br>A final thank you to all who have donated to this cause, those who haven't, my justgiving page is open until end September.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DavoSingapore.svg" alt=Davo-Singapore> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Davo-Singapore</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-06-30 01:57:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Thanks for sharing.
