These people lobbied to remove all the banking restrictions and regualtions. I refuse to believe they didn't know what they were doing. Even I can see that selling money to people that can never afford to pay it back is morally wrong and a time bomb waiting to go off. <br>I'm not one for conspiracy theories but you have to wonder, who had the most to gain from this chain of events? Did the people at the very top lose everything? In fact did they lose anything at all. All that money didn't just disappear. I would in fact image they made a shit load. <br> <br>Problem is the public as a whole are just sheep, they might question something for 5 mins once in a while but then we just drift back in to our lives and it just carries on again. I know I'm only really screwing again about this as I've just watched the movie, give it a few days/weeks and it will drift in to the back of my mind. Meanwhile somehow billions of $/£ have disappeared into the ether. The fact that the lady from the Oversight committee who's role it is to oversee where the money went, can't get any answers scares the shit out of me. As it should everyone else. <br> <br>You are right Jules, a run on the banks would have been shite for us minions and the government was left with no choice but to bail them out. Somehow though they have not only got us all into this shite state of affairs but there has been no suggestion that the immoral actions of the people at the top being made to pay for it. Less than 2 years later billions are being dished out in bonuses and so they are happy as again. It seems morally wrong to me. And personally I think it's a fooked state of affairs.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Reb.svg" alt=Reb> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Reb</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-10 23:08:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Duke4Dirk.svg" alt=Duke4Dirk> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Duke4Dirk</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-10 23:41:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Duke4Dirk.svg" alt=Duke4Dirk> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Duke4Dirk</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-11 01:34:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>You may not like Michael Moore or agree with his style, but he does know his shit.
