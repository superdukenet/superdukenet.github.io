RIP to the riders who lost their lives on Sunday.<br><br>Ended up riding up at night basically. Taken from my post in my HID thread, "Ended up leaving at like 5:30 and ate but then had to come back because of the light. Then on my way again I my oem light bulb blew at around the 200mile mark. A chp pulled up on me and was like "im not going to let you ride without a light. Do you want a tow truck?" Obviously there's no way I wanted to pay for a tow truck. After like 10 min he ended up hitting up a buddy of his who ran a little bike shop who had an h4 bulb. So he drove me like 30min away and I bought it from the guy, then he drove me back to my bike."<br><br>Here's a picture of all our bikes (stayed with my buddies at a hotel in Monterey).<br><br><br>Ended up finding out that Dribble (Doug) was up here so I made my way over to his camp site and met up with him. Here's a picture of his camp site.... living in style on the high rise haha. <br><br>Idc what anyone says, Doug's a cool dude! He's actually a normal guy in person, for all of you who won't believe me based on how he posts here sometimes. Spent a few hours with him and his son and a few other old dudes at his camp site, was a good time. He even gave me a few beers and food (what more can you ask for??)<br><br>Whatever the case, I'll definitely be seeing you there next year as well man. <br><br>Obligatory pic of both of us.<br><br><br>Had to be at work at 4pm on Monday. Decided I didn't want to leave super early in the morning (night) to ride the coast because it would have been way too damn cold. So I took the most direct route, which should have been fine and left around 9am.<br>Halfway between the 101 and 5 on the 46, the side oil cover decided to loosen itself up while I was going about 95 and dumped 3 quarts of oil onto my rear tyre. Luckily I managed to stay up (though it got hairy for a little bit lol) and pulled over. After a couple hours of sitting in the sun and eventually pushing my bike down the highway, a nice dude (forgot him and his wife/gf's name (I was kind of dehydrated and not 100%) (sorry man!)I guess he is a corner flagger for Socal track days at chuckwalla every month and did some corner work at the races) in his camper towing his rsv4 pulled over and helped me load my bike onto his small trailer. we took it slow to the next gas station about 20min away, where i fixed up my bike and put some car oil in there to make it home. I ended up riding straight into work about 4 hours late. finally got home at 3am.<br><br>Obligatory pic of me on the side of the road.<br><br>Well I guess we shall see what happens next year.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=DribbleDuke" alt=DribbleDuke> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">DribbleDuke</h3> <time datetime="2015-07-22 22:19:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2015-07-22 22:19:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Since landing a campsite on the hill my World Superbike weekends are about great campfire laughs surrounded by great racing. It was my pleasure to meet and hang for a bit with David. He is invited to share a bit of dirt at 124 next year as the more the merrier. The spaces are filled with mostly ride ins and as I have a truck I bring the wood and a couple extra ice chests to help the riders keep their shit cold. I have had the same neighbors for three years now and it is getting to be where we know each other rather close (no, not that close). I expressed with David that it would be a great Superduke venue and a spot on top of the hill would make a great meet-up. Bassagent isn't as fishy as I thought. Hell, even Digger liked him </div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=Matteson" alt=Matteson> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Matteson</h3> <time datetime="2015-07-23 01:02:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2015-07-23 01:02:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Very cool guys! We have lots of Buell meet ups as well. The superduke croud kinda reminds me of the same kind of people. You know, kinda cultish. I like having a different bike. Always have.
