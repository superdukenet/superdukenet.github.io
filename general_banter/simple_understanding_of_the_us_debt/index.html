Anybody able to count can see that we need to spend about 15% less overall but it's not as simple as it sounds. Some expenditure can't be cut, like the cost of servicing the existing debt burden which in our case is about £43 Billion a year. Other things could be cut but would result in breach of contract costs or additional costs in other areas equal to or greater than the amounts saved. Other things are just very sensitive and unpopular with the public so politically difficult.<br><br>We wine about politicians being self serving but honestly, by and large they are just doing what we say we want them too. Personally I would favour a more self reliant world but I'm in a tiny minority on this. Most people expect the state to be there as a fall back safety net, to defend the country, represent it abroad, take care of the weak and voulnerable, educate our children, look after national infrastructure, provide a justice system and on and on and on. All these things are expensive yet everybody moans about paying for them.<br><br>As I understand it in California there is a referendum system. People put up expensive propositions for things the state should do, they are nice so people vote for them, when the coresponding tax rises are proposed poeple vote them down. More and more unfunded commitments and under different systems the same things happen over and over in many democracies.<br><br>My point is a simple one. We are all in this state because as societies we ask government to do more and more of what we used to do ourselves but we refuse to fund the activity properly. Taxes will go up, standards of living will go down as reality will have to bite eventually and this is not our politicians fault. It's our fault, by and large we voted for it!!<br><br>If I stood for election in this country telling ther truth, that your asset values would decrease by about 20%, that taxes needed to rise and programs needed to be cut accross the board and that it would still take more than a decade to turn the debt burden around I would be lucky if my mum voted for me!! IMHO we get the representation we deserve, if it's feeble and craven then perhaps we should all man up a bit or just stop moaning.<br><br>Arhhhhh, I feel better now </div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=shadowman" alt=shadowman> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">shadowman</h3> <time datetime="2011-08-01 16:48:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-08-01 16:48:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Can I have a go on your soap box now?<br>The big issue is public spending on the NHS and public services in the UK.

In that case, everybody suffers including not only the special interest groups mentioned above, who at least have some hand in whatever misfortunes might befall them, but also innocents - babies, children, disabled people, the elderly etc who through no fault of their own cannot look after themselves. <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #BF0000">Sounds good but sets up a false choice. High risk life choices are not what is at the root of the problem, if anything it's low risk ones that add the cost. The single biggest factor is age, the longer you live the more you cost, it's that simple. If we want things to be more sustainable we either need to die sooner or work longer, everything else is on the margins and makes no significant difference. If cost is the issue then smoking, drinking, fat bike racers should be encouraged at every opportunity!</span></span> <br><br>I am tired of seeing the news full of complacent morons bleating on about how hard things already are, and how the cuts will make it impossible for them to live.

In fact as a big arms exporter I think we should see it as a major enrichment opportunity. The only real flash point I can think of is Taiwan and my money would be on a diplomatic / economic solution. There is a predictable cycle to these things although the timing is inherently unpredictable.<br>Labour intensive things migrate to areas of lower labour costs which in recent history has meant from west to east. This leads to industrialisation of previously agrarian societies and, with this, in time expectations rise. These societies become better educated, less isolated and wealthier until their costs force the labour intensive activity elsewhere. They have an increasing interest in world stability as this is the basis for their prosperity.<br><br>Already Chinese jobs are going to Africa and so it goes on. My guess is that China will have its hands full trying to keep its middle classes quiet, I don’t see them bombing anybody until vital resources really start to run low in which case all bets are off everywhere.<br><br><br>Smokers, the fat, risk takers and feckless lazy bastards:<br><br>You make an enticingly attractive sounding argument but as with most things the devil is in the detail. Who decides who is deserving or not deserving. What happens when the same person falls on both sides of the divide, how could you ever assess the opportunity cost given that you can’t know when a treatment is needed what somebody may subsequently contribute to society. Do you just let the undeserving, who can’t pay, die?<br><br>I don’t smoke by the way (although I did for years) I’m not fat, I work (have run my own businesses for 20 years) although I might qualify under the bastard bit of this heading<br><br>The old:<br><br>My dad hates getting old but as we have laughed on several occasions, what’s the alternative! A mate of mine is a prof of public health at Oxford University so whilst I’m no expert I have had discussions with someone who is. I believe on average 90% (ish) of all the health resource spent on you happens in the last few years of your life. Some of the largest public purse issues are health, long term care and pensions. We leave education later, work for fewer years and live much longer than was the case when the welfare system was designed. It really is the case that all the big cost is in support of the retired. If members of the previous group die a few years ahead of what would otherwise be the case then in cost terms at least they are doing the rest of us a big favour.<br><br><br>Population control:<br><br>You are right of course, there must be a finite capacity for the earth to support human populations. There seems to be a big debate about what this number is but I don’t think there is any debate that at some stage it’s too many.<br><br>Nature has a way of dealing with overpopulation. It’s brutal but some combination of starvation, disease, conflict and predation returns numbers to a more manageable levels. Perhaps this brings us back to your China crisis but there is another possible scenario. The better educated and wealthier a society becomes the fewer children they have. Perhaps then, India and China will stabilise as will other areas as the manufacturing jobs get pushed around the globe and wealth spreads more evenly. Weather we have time for this to work through is anybody’s guess. My only thought on artificial population control is that wherever it has been tried before it has failed and also introduced population distortions (usually in the form of a lack of girls) which bring with them further problems.<br><br>Debt<br><br><br>And the immediate issue of public debt...... Well we have too much of it so we need to spend less and repay some. In the past the way advanced economies, even the Americans, have got off the debt hook is to allow a bit of extra inflation into the system. This has the effect of reducing the real value of the debt, it’s a form of soft default and it’s what I think is already quietly going on now.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=JohnJJr" alt=JohnJJr> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">JohnJJr</h3> <time datetime="2011-08-04 14:57:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-08-04 14:57:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Just had a really interesting conversation with a specialist nurse running their Diabetes Clinic.
