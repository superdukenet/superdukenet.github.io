I have no personal experience of running my own business, but you have to start somewhere....<br><br>Its basically a bike time-share - you pay an annual membership fee which entitles you to a number of points which equate to bike use over the course of the year/riding season. There would be a selection of bikes to choose from. <br><br>There are quite a few supercar clubs where you pay an annual fee and get the opportunity to drive a range of top-end cars without the associated costs of ownership but there is potentially a gap in the market and as far a I know there is currently only one bike share club in the UK that does this, they are based in the Midlands:<br><br><a class=postlink href="http://www.spyderclub.co.uk/index.php/1/home/">http://www.spyderclub.co.uk/index.php/1/home/</a><br><br><br>The benefits of membership obviously need to be sufficient to attract potential customers. I see these as:<br>- the opportunity to ride the latest cutting edge sports bikes (or perhaps adventure bikes, tourers or even Harleys).<br>- the ability to choose what and when to ride and the number of days use required (this could be done through a tiered membership).<br>- not having to cover costs - outright purchase, tax, insurance, servicing, running costs (tyres, chain and sprockets, brake pads etc), repairs and depreciation (plus the time and hassle associated with sorting these issues out).<br>- not having to worry about storage - garage space, security etc.<br><br>The major issue as I see it is insurance, the cost of which may be prohibitive. It will be a balancing act to make cost of membership attractive to potential customers whilst still being a viable business. There would need to be a significant excess on the insurance which the member would have to pay in the event of an accident etc. There may also be a requirement for members to have an existing no claims bonus - this counters the potential for members who don't own bikes or who haven't for a couple of years (I would guess these are the largest potential member group). I am working on how to overcome that one.<br><br>If annual membership is in the region of Â£2000, many people would say "I could buy a second-hand bike and run it for that". This would be missing the point and those people aren't the target market. I would be looking for people with a large disposable income who want to ride (or be seen on!) the latest bikes but for whatever reason don't want to be bothered with the hassles of ownership. Surely such a person exists? Maybe not the type who frequent this site? But everyone must know someone who fits into this category. There are a lot of wealthy footballers not a million miles away from here - they would be ideal 'members' if only their contracts allowed them to ride bikes. The question is how to target this market.<br><br>My plan is to start small with low overheads, test the market then expand gradually. I will be undertaking other business interests at the same time in the first year to ensure a regular income, so a break-even in the first year will be acceptable. My first step is to speak to some insurance companies which I am in the process of doing as well as undertaking some market research - this is as valuable a forum as any for that.<br><br>I am aware that this isn't the market place for such a business, as we are all committed to and passionate about the Superduke. The idea doesn't attract me personally as a member either as I would always want to own my own bike and I have a tendency to keep them for a while.<br><br>But everyone here must have friends who are into bikes generally and have a licence but don't own one for whatever reason. Perhaps given the right incentive these people would become members. We all know folk who go out and buy the latest bike, fancy leathers etc then wobble round occasionally at weekends 'posing'. These are just the sort of people who would benefit from this kind of venture.<br><br>I would be interested to hear people's views here; all discussion is good and there is a wealth of experience here in the world of biking.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=tripoddave" alt=tripoddave> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">tripoddave</h3> <time datetime="2011-11-15 12:31:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2011-11-15 12:31:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>I've just been trying to find the website but been unsuccessful.<br>There is a company that turns up at some trackdays with bikes for customers, runs bikes on the road for them much in the same way: customers buy points packages and the bikes are delivered for use serviced ready to go.

Talking to him, insurance wasn't the obvious killer because cover was only paid when the vehicle was under hire. I'm not sure your business model of a subscription fee is sustainable, it puts your client base in a niche of a niche. Consider more innovative models like EasyJet's, where the further ahead you book the better the price is. These bookings cover your costs while the later, more expensive booking provide your profit. <br><br>Finding your customer is going to be one of the biggest hurdles, it is for most businesses, especially start-ups.
