My current daily driver is a super clean 2005 RX8 with 85K miles on it. It's mechinaclly 100% but I've had it for 8 years and I'm ready to move on to something with more trunk space, better mpg!!!!, but still very fun to drive. I love this car and I've done all the best bolt on mods there are for it but again, it's time to move on. <br><br>Iniitally I was thinking a Mk6 GTI. Test drove one and it's a fantastic automobile, no other way to put it. Easy clutch, fun tubo, nice interior, good fuel milage and was really fun to drive. Now that the Mk7 is out (initally limited in America) I'm also looking at one of those. Has anyone here driven both a Mk6 and Mk7? The online reviews between the 2 aren't that detailed. Of course I'll go and look/test drive one when I get a chance.<br><br>The other vehicle I was looking is surprisingly different and similar to the GTI. A C5 has a huge trunk (the whole back half of the car), gets about 30 mpg, roomy interior though it doesn't have anything on the GTI's in terms of styling and quality, but is probably more fun to drive than even a GTI. The removable roof is a plus for me too a good conditioned car goes for right around $10K less than a new and laoded GTI. I trust a Corvette's mechanical reliablity as well since they're so simple yet effecient. I've never owned a VW before but I have worked on my friends Jetta before and it was a bit of a pain/on the pricey side for normal parts. <br><br>I literally have no idea where I'll be living at my next job, but the GTI should be better in bad weather and cheaper on insurance. I would have to spend a good amount of my savings on the Corvette on the interior with a better stereo and seats. Running costs are kind of split. Just looking for some more insight. If I found the right C5 I would take a serious look at it, it would have to be every bit as clean as my current car, not a run down and highly modded C5 that's been beat at the track it's whole life. The convenience of being able to order a brand new Mk7 with all the options I want is appealing too.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=kevxtx" alt=kevxtx> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">kevxtx</h3> <time datetime="2014-07-14 08:49:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2014-07-14 08:49:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>I can speak for the GTI they are great cars, the new 7 generation is very refined.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=shadowman" alt=shadowman> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">shadowman</h3> <time datetime="2014-07-14 11:13:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2014-07-14 11:13:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Not sure if you have this option or would consider it but I have just done 2 years and 40K miles in a Golf GTD<br><br>It drives much like a GTI, bit more lower down, bit less up top but handles and looks the same.

A C6 actually costs as much as a fully loaded new GTI but it has the same problems as the C5 (crappy wheels, interior, etc) so I may as well save $10K to put towards fixing those issues. <br><br>The GTI interests me because I've never owned a 100% new car before.

Wife's 2011 golf family wagon,(comfort line), and my 2007 Rabbit ,( 2door sport package),with 5 speed. <br>Wife's wagon is the vehicle of choice for family taxi, errands, and trips. Rabbit is my daily commuter that gets it's fair share of taxi and errand duty.<br> Golf is just pleasant and does everything no fuss. Wheels are soft and needed replacing.<br> Rabbit is a bit fun to drive. Gripes about the rabbit are that the keys bother my knee in an annoying way and that it is front wheel drive. The front wheel drive issue is what spoils it for me during winter driving fun and summer back road misbehaving. VW rust prevention on my 2007, while better than my earlier golfs, still leaves something to be desired. So far it has had the hood and two fenders replaced and a quarter panel repaired and painted under the 12 year rust warranty. <br><br>Hope the newest VW versions have learned lessons from the previous incarnations as it's likely we'll be replacing them with newer models when the kids inherit these ones.<br><br>Sporting rear wheel drive cars are more fun?
