We killed six million Jews and replaced them with 20 million Muslims. In Auschwitz we burned a culture, thought, creativity, talent. We destroyed the chosen people, truly chosen, because they produced great and wonderful people who changed the world.<br> <br>The contribution of this people is felt in all areas of life: science, art, international trade, and above all, as the conscience of the world. These are the people we burned.<br> <br>And under the pretence of tolerance, and because we wanted to prove to ourselves that we were cured of the disease of racism, we opened our gates to 20 million Muslims, who brought us stupidity and ignorance, religious extremism and lack of tolerance, crime and poverty, due to an unwillingness to work and support their families with pride.<br> <br>They have blown up our trains and turned our beautiful Spanish cities into the third world, drowning in filth and crime.<br> <br>Shut up in the apartments they receive free from the government, they plan the murder and destruction of their naive hosts.<br> <br>And thus, in our misery, we have exchanged culture for fanatical hatred, creative skill for destructive skill, intelligence for backwardness and superstition.<br> <br>We have exchanged the pursuit of peace of the Jews of Europe and their talent for a better future for their children, their determined clinging to life because life is holy, for those who pursue death, for people consumed by the desire for death for themselves and others, for our children and theirs.<br> <br>What a terrible mistake was made by miserable Europe ..<br> <br>The Global Islamic population is approximately 1,200,000,000; that is ONE BILLION TWO HUNDRED MILLION or 20% of the world's population.

The Jews don't hijack planes, nor kill athletes at the Olympics, or blow themselves up in German restaurants. There is NOT one single Jew who has destroyed a church.

I speak as one who feels that all monotheistic religions are equally absurd. In fact if we are looking at religious texts alone then the Jewish faith uses what I believe Christians refer to as the old testament as its guide and this is stuffed full of smoting, tribal genocide, gang rape and intolerance of idolaters in a way that would make Quentin Tarintino blush if not actually weep!<br><br>The urge to mark out groups and belong seems intrinsic to the human condition. From early tribalism through nationalism and various religious affiliations we seem to need and in-group / out-group situation to make sense of the world. Does anybody think all straight people are the same? The idea is absurd yet the use of “Gay Community” remains as widespread as ever as far as I can see. Nominally I am a Christian but does that give me anything automatically in common with say one of the Christian sect members of some evangelical church in the bible belt, not at all. To assume that you can group widely disparate people and peoples under a single religious banner and make homogeneous assumptions about them is utterly stupid.<br><br>To address our mythical Spaniard directly. It was the mass of disenfranchised, unemployed and hopeless German people after the first war who were attracted toward national socialism with its simple “Germans are great” all our problems are somebody else’s fault messages. With promises of simple solutions, organisation and a bright future an educated and previously cultured people bought into this en mass. Any of that sound familiar? I wonder if we can think of any current examples of disenfranchised, unemployed, often poorly educated and hopeless populations and population groups being offered excuses and simple solutions to rally behind.<br><br>Here in the UK we had a terrorist problem for many years which draped itself in the Irish flag and the banner of Catholicism. Did this mean Catholics were fanatical killers and the Irish state was at some kind of proxy war with us? Of course not, they were just convenient covers and rallying points (desperados always appeal to nationalism, religion or group loyalty) to be used by people pursuing power.<br><br>I have spent some time in Israel even sky diving over the Negev at night where you could see the lights from several Arab countries as well as two continents on the way down. I found Israeli jews to be as varied (from close minded bigots to full on party animals) as any other nation you could name with very little by way of homogenous characteristics (bit of understandable paranoia perhaps) on display. I have not spent much time in Arab nations but my guess is that underneath the national political level and the grinding need to provide for a family in difficult circumstances the same truth would apply.<br><br>We have lots of immigrant populations here in the UK and a tiny but noisy Muslim extremist element that is often on TV being offensive. There are many areas in cities where a ghetto mentality rules and their dominant groups come in all shades of colour from lily white to black. Ethnic on ethnic violence is by far the biggest element of racially inspired problems over here at least.<br><br>My point is a simple one. Implying that all muslims are bad is as childish and pointless as stating that all Christians (or whoever) are good. Bad people are bad and they come in all shapes and colours. Speaking for myself I’m as happy attacking fundamentalists and violent manipulative idiots of any shade as I am defending reasonable free thinking people regardless of their point of origin. If people would only think instead of accepting easy clichés and spoon fed partial news we would all have a lot less problems.<br><br>I seem to have become incapable of short posts, perhaps I should get out more (or do some work instead of grazing SD.net) Probably just need a cute female naval to gaze at instead of my own!!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MrZ32.svg" alt=MrZ32> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">MrZ32</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-24 12:12:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>the problem that i find is that it is the free thinking people that seem to give up their rights so readily for political correctness that the other party (whether it is christian, muslim... they are all the same and actually believe in the same God believe it or not) before you know it things start going backwards and it is too little too late.<br><br>This is my concern.

New technology excites me more than developments of old stuff as the gains can be far greater:)</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Schnauzer.svg" alt=Schnauzer> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Schnauzer</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-24 15:54:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-24 15:57:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Have to say guys this is bordering on offensive and really has no place on a motorcycle forum. This is however the internet, I'm all for free speech and not one for censorship but I could find loads of emails "sent from a friend" that cover and insult just about every ethnic minority/religion/sexual orientation you care to mention. This does not make them right. Most are based on ignorance or have a not so hidden agenda to them. <br><br>I'll leave it open for now but I'll be keeping an eye on it and have to warn you that if it gets out of hand it will be locked and possibly other action taken. Please consider this when you post and don't force us moderators to moderate. On the whole this forum is well balanced and a place free of prejudice other than against IL4s. Please lets keep it that way.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Dutch.svg" alt=Dutch> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Dutch</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-24 18:43:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>The mods are conferring to decide whether or not to close this thread.<br><br>We all hate censorship, but we also hate unwinnable arguements and unsupprted ideaology causing offense or big argueements on a bike forum which is here to celebrate what we all share - i.e. bikes - and not what divides us.<br><br>There are thousands of other forums for religious opinion.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Reb.svg" alt=Reb> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Reb</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-24 21:11:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>This is a heavy subject for only my second cup of coffee this morning, but here goes. Before you allow youself to be swayed by either side of this debate, consider a third angle, manipulation.<br><br>In 1871 a man named Albert Pike, a high degree Mason, wrote a letter to a colleague outlining their (Masons) plan for world conquest. It was to comprise of three World Wars. The first was to stir up trouble between the English and Germanic empires, to oust the Czars from Russia and create Communism. The second was again to bring a clash between England and Germany with the ultimate aim of creating a homeland for the Jews.<br><br> The third is to bring a clash between the Jews and Muslims, with the aim of both groups destroying each other, and ulitmately all established religions. At this point the people (those left alive) will rise up and demand and end to all wars and religious diversity. Those pulling the strings will gladly step in and present their ready to go World Government and World Religion (Satanism).<br><br>As incredulous as this may sound to a lot of people, the runs are on the board as far as the previous wars. The daily news tells us that planning for the third is well advanced, with the two sides (Muslim and Jew) both being expertly manipulated towards their starting positions.<br><br>Only a few years ago if you mentioned World Government, you were laughed at and called a conspiracy nut. Now, World leaders and the media talk of little else.<br>A previous British PM (I think) said that nothing in politics happens by chance, EVERYTHING is planned.<br><br>So, what I'm saying is we are being manipulated into taking a position on this so we are divided into opposing sides (divided we fall). Always try to look behind what is presented to us as 'reality' because what they present to us is BS, a smokescreen to hide the real agenda.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/mrduke.svg" alt=mrduke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">mrduke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-24 21:41:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/jambox.svg" alt=jambox> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">jambox</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-25 01:11:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>[quote="Colonel_Klinck"] On the whole this forum is well balanced and a place free of prejudice other than against IL4s.

Three reasons, each of which would be enough on their own:<br><br>1. The original post is spam; a reposted chain letter. We are being used to propogate it.<br><br>2. The original post is totally unrelated to KTMs, Superdukes, Bike Culture, Lifestyle, Attitude, Banter, Jokes, etc,<br><br>3. Some people have found it offensive, and we would prefer the forum to remind us of what unites us, i.e. Bikes &amp; Superdukes, than what divides us.<br><br>In summary, this bike forum is not the appropriate forum for this kind of debate, and the web has plenty of other places, just one click away, that are ideal. Please feel free to go elsewhere and continue. e.g. <a class=postlink href="http://www.ukdebate.co.uk/forums/">http://www.ukdebate.co.uk/forums/</a><br><br>Finally, this is not up for debate.
