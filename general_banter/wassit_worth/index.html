I still have the SDR as I never intended to sell it but I am now quite tempted with the 1290 GT as a touring bike. I am going for a test ride on Friday and assuming I like the GT I have a dilemma<br><br>I am not really keeping up with used bike values in the UK, hate selling bikes, really really really hate p/exing bikes so I am looking for a bit of advice as to the value of my bike and the bits and bobs if I end up selling them separately. This will have to be from memory as I have owned the bike for 9 years and been adding bits all along so I probably won't remember everything I have got.<br><br>I am not selling anything yet, if at all, so I don't want a load of pm's with daft bids or texts at midnight asking 'WOT LOWEST YA TEK?" I really can't be arsed with that. I just know that Dealers, in general tend to offer insulting p/ex prices around Â£2-3k less than a private sale and I will probably end up selling the bike and bits privately if I go with the 1290 GT.<br><br>Bike is a 2007 SDR (single seat model) 12000 miles from new with full service history. I have owned it since 2009 and I bought it off the original owner with 2000 miles on the clock. The bike is mint condition and has almost all standard parts (I will list the bits I don't have). THIS MODEL DID NOT HAVE THE AKRA HEADERS LIKE THE 2008 SDR. It is currently SORN and not insured (so no test rides) as my insurer, Hastings Direct, will only let me have 2 bikes on the policy. Bike will have 12 months MOT when p/exed or sold. Tyres are good Dunlop sports tyres and I have a half decent set of Metzler Racetec / Pirelli Supercorsa K2/K3's that aren't fitted to rims.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Bits I can't remove are:</span><br><br>Forks rebuilt by HM Racing in 2010<br><br>Suspension fully serviced and set up by Steve Jordan racing in 2015<br><br>KTM alarm (Meta)<br><br>KTM Powerparts anodised Orange reservoir covers for clutch front and back brake cylinder.

For a few reasons.<br><br>First, the market has moved on with the 1290 so a lot of people would just want this newer model and consider the 990 a bit outdated now - even though it's great, competent motorbike still.<br><br>Second, the casualty of all this is that 990 prices have peaked now and even with a fully loaded bike with lots of upgrades (like yours and mine) just don't really command a premium price.<br><br>Decent, well looked after, low mileage 990s seem to be consistently holding their value in private sales in the range of Â£3.500 to Â£5,000.<br><br>As you know, you'd be better off returning to a more standard spec. and selling the bling separately. This is what I'd do if I wanted to sell - but I'm also aware that the bling/performance parts market is now not as healthy as it was because most 990 Superdukes have already been upgraded and there isn't a new generation of owners out there looking for stuff. They all have 1290s!<br><br>I reckon you should still get about Â£5,000 for yours - I think that's what it's worth but whether you'll find a buyer quickly is another matter. <br><br>If you do split stuff I'd be very interested in your carbon wheels. I've been looking for years, nearly got some back in about 2009 from a forum member in Germany but it all fell through. It's the last bit of carbon I don't have on mine! ha ha.
