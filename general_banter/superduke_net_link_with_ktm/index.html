Except for an inexcusable detour onto a Honda VFR I haven't owned any other make of bike for this time. I am a die-hard KTM fan and my posts on this site will corroborate this fact. Been a big supporter of their brand and values and products that the've designed, manufactured and delivered.<br><br>As I have been honest in saying across a lot of our Superduke.net threads, I'm disappointed with the 1290, so much so that I'm not going to buy one. And as time goes on I'm less frustrated with the minor frustrations with the new bike, (and they are pretty minor really), but more with the attitude with KTM and their dealer response. Everything about the hype, the launch, the availability and the shoddy way the bikes are being prepared and delivered to new customers is below what I expect or believed possible from KTM.<br><br>But what I want to ask from this thread is why, after all this time, all these years, does KTM not feel it appropriate, or beneficial, to appropriate and delegate a person to our forum?<br><br>An official KTM representative, with authority to comment and respond to posts, would be hugely welcome on this site. Why have they not realised this and put forward people to do so? The guy, I think Sexparty, from Aus who works for a KTM dealer is the only person I've read on here who admits to his affiliations with the company.<br><br>Come on KTM, get involved, communicate with your long term customer base for Christ sake!!!<br><br>Solve the issues before they become damaging to your brand and loyal following. If you want to use modern channels of communication, ie. the internet and shit to aggressively hype and promote your products then fooking use them to them afterwards to nurture and bond with your loyal fans.<br><br>Or alienate and lose them.....<br><br>your choice...........</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Miki.svg" alt=Miki> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Miki</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-04-27 19:13:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I agree!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/JimH.svg" alt="Jim H"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Jim H</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-04-27 19:13:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I am so damn nervous of this bike and all the horror stories about the bike and dealer support.

KTM know I'm going not to quit pursuing class action so my point is that if all of the issues were responsibly addressed instead of being swept under the carpet, people like myself wouldn't have to take their criticisms to court and suffer massive financial losses because they haven't delivered what I've been expected to pay for.<br><br>Sadly they appear to rely too much on CAD proofing instead of real world testing. The 1290 paint chips are a good example - why was paint thickness not accounted for in CAD design? These issues may be minor but it's the 21st century, it shouldn't be happening. By comparison, if one company can get it right, the other has no excuse. Origin of assembly should make no difference either.<br><br>KTM's marketing budget is testament to this corner cutting and it's insane. Ducati have got their act together, no doubt in part to their newish owners - VAG group. KTM's profits are there to view for all so why not invest in the refinement of the brand?<br><br>Their attitude (and betrayal of my loyalty at least) is appalling &amp; it doesn't have to be this way.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DucatiPete.svg" alt="Ducati Pete"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Ducati Pete</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2014-04-27 19:19:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Ah heck, he's on his soapbox again <br><br>I think the reason the haven't is because as this is an open forum, anyone can say anything (to some degree, until the mods intervene) they want.

Brand values are aggregate perceptual outcomes based around suggested themes with highly selective reinforcements conveyed to the largest possible audience at the lowest possible cost. Does anybody here think KTM really has any values beyond growth and return on investment for the owners? When you are a niche player making quirky product for a neglected sub set of a market one thing suits, when you are moving into a mass manufacturing established big player role something else is needed building on what marketing types are fond of describing as 'brand heritage'<br><br>It's all coblers really. The bike seems great, they are selling as many as they can make at a premium price, the halo effect on smaller and cheaper products will multiply the profits nicely and no doubt they are now working on a teaser campaign for the all new 1300 RC9 as I type. As long as the bulk supply isn't too delayed and these alleged engine failures turn out to be the exception instead of the rule then I cant see how it could be going much better for them.<br><br>Jim - Fingers crossed for you later this week. I had thought Lloyds might settle on the steps given the recent judgement in the laptop case.

The offers just keep arriving, this week i should decide, i am thinking v4 aprilia if i do change and do not know if touno or rsv, either would be a new one.</div></p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="about.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="terms.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
