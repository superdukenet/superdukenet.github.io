This one is really hard to call. Stoner must be favorite at Quatar but he wasnt fastest in practise today. He was .2 sec behind Pedrosa.<br><br>Spies was in 4th only 0.1 seconds adrift of Stoner and ahead of Lorenzo<br><br>Rossi was 8th 0.8 sec adrift of the lead and Hayden was right behind him.<br><br>Less than 2 seconds covered all 18 riders and the slowest wasnt Abraham it was Toni Elias, with Crutchlow just in front of him.<br><br>Are Ducati giving everything? It must be less than likely with Rossi's previous form. I would really love to see Rossi win the opening GP on the Ducati like he did for Yamaha at Welcom. Rossi is certainly capable of jumping a 0.8 sec gap but in previous tests the Ducati has done ok on day 1 and got worse over the next few days.<br><br>Stoner on a Honda is the safest bet if he can keep it upright. Many seem to think he has the championship in the bag already. Maybe they forget he has a habit of crashing Hondas as well as Ducatis. Also if Stoner doesnt get a big lead early on in races and in the championship he will find some excuse and whinge his way out of contention: big boys play too rough, lactose intollerent, crew chief shagging mrs Stoner, who knows what it will be this year. Honda have dressed him up like the second coming of Doohan. I bet Doohan will be fuggin angry if Stoner makes a twat of himself again.<br><br>Pedrosa still thinks he can win a championship. I dont think Honda are as convinced though. Having Stoner as a team mate may get the best from Pedrosa. More likely they will both pull out huge leads in races, win some and throw others away in unforced errors. Could be Rossi or Lorenzo wont have to win many races to win the championship if they both get a few DNF's.<br><br>Spies is the dark horse. He really hasnt put a foot wrong yet and I dont think anyone could rule him out of this years title chase. I would be happy if he just beats his team mate and wins a couple of races.<br><br>Lorenzo I think will start crashing again. He had his charmed season last year. I dont see that happening again. I hope he doesnt win a single race, not least beacause I cant stand his despicable celebrations.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MADDOG53.svg" alt=MADDOG53> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">MADDOG53</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-14 23:34:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Luke<br>I cant stand his despicable celebrations.<br>And I couldn't stand that "gold ,jewel encrusted helmet" what a douche bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-15 01:09:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>My money is on Stoner. He knows how to circle that track real well. Spies showed great form on that track also. I have been under the impression that this years race is in the daylight. I may be confusing it with the Daytona 200, but I thought it was both venues. I do not have much faith in Ducati giving Rossi what he needs to win a single race this year. I am going to go Stoner- Pedrosa-Lorenzo-Spies-Dovisiosa-Simencelli-Hayden-Rossi-Edwards- then who cares from there. Either way, It will be a great kick off for any of the riders and this year with all riders enjoying championship status, fills the need to show top dogness right off the bat.

That wouldnt suprise me in the least.<br><br>Honda have the nost motivation as they forced in the 800 class in the first place. Their secret weapon, Pedrosa, has failed to dominate so now they are split betting by running two aliens and proven race winners in the same team. Usual Honda thinking, the bike is perfect we just need a rider capable of riding it. I wuld love to see it bite them on the arse. Stoner and Pedrosa are both likely to get duffed up in a battle situation. When they win they run away from corner 1, lap 1. They are both prone to crashing out of a good lead too. Perhaps the added pressure from within the team will make this happen more this year?<br><br>Lorenzo will be defending his no 1 plate against Spies primarily. Again the added pressure of being the top man at Yamaha and fighting off a hungry team mate may be more pressure than he has coped with previously.<br><br>Also, dont forget the other factors, Ducati spent big to get Rossi only to find he is self funding in attracting sponsors. Yamaha cant even get a sponsor. No Jap manufacturer can be selling more bikes this year than in previous years with the strength of ther yen. I bet Ducati are selling them as fast as they can make them. Also Freestylers curse, this earthquake / Tsunami / nuclear disaster is going to set Japan's economy back a decade at least. Could be all the Jap factories run out of development money early in the season? <br><br>Whatever happens I will be watching Rossi in my new 42 quid!! </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Stratkat.svg" alt=Stratkat> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Stratkat</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-16 03:03:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>as much as id like to see Rossi win right from the start, im thinking he'll probably place in the top 5, and Spies somewhere in the top 3.<br>Stoner will probably win the thing. cant wait though, let the games begin!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/BASH69.svg" alt=BASH69> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">BASH69</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-16 08:49:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Stupid Luke,<br><br>You are on my wave length for this subject.

and will do it again, no question, it's rossi' hypocritical behaviour towards his peers that has me cheering against him, his antics are a bit old these days too, not that we're likely to see too many more, he's past it and his deal with ducati is purely to set up his cushy retirement. you know? an italian associated with an italian factory, much like Ago with MV. Rossi' big mouth about Stoner not being able to ride the ducati will come back and bite him soon enough.<br>oh, since when do you need to have a mischevious personality to win? Rainey, Gardner, Lawson, Doohan, Spencer, all of them incredibly serious focussed individuals who worked very hard to achieve their goal. rossi has 9 championships, true, but Randy Mamola was the best personality in the paddock, he finished 2nd four times because he was a party animal and not ruthless enough to mix it with guys who wanted it more. Rossi has had his day, if it's not Stoner i hope it's Spies.<br><br>paul</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MrZ32.svg" alt=MrZ32> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">MrZ32</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-19 08:50:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>you dont think that somone deserves to do well because you dont like his personality?

The over shoot of turn one by Spies was all a ploy to set Rossi up for a pass on the third times the charm. Stoner did not put a wheel out of place the whole race and made the Honda look like it was made for him like he made the Ducati look in 2007. Semincelli is going to mess up the fourth to sixth place racers all season long while the front pack dissapears. Someone will get tired of his shinangans and punt him off the track. Probably be DePuniet, he seems to like only one or two laps anyway. The three Repsol Honda's are hard to follow and feel out of place on a MotoGP grid. Thank goodness that Casey's numbers are in blue or I would have a hard tyme distinguishing them from each other. I wish Moto Two was on Sunday also. I will not get enough racing on Sunday, unless World or American racing is on. Rossi has his work cut out for him, the bike looks very sketchy at mid-corner. Good on Cal Crutchlow. He may never be close to the top but he does look like a racer out there. If there is someone to pass you can bet he aint going to hold back and circle the track like Nicky does. Nicky looks like Kenny Roberts Jr. in his final seasons, circling for the paycheck. Loris too.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/lc4.svg" alt=lc4> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">lc4</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-22 08:48:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>ON YA STONER !!!!!!! </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/browser.svg" alt=browser> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">browser</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-22 08:50:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="about.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="terms.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
