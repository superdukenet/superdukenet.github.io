Beautifully designed, cleverly thought out and offer fantastic customer support. The operating system (OSX Snow Leopard is the latest incarnation) is really what makes Macs so great. It is so user friendly. Yes it will take a little while to adjust from Windows but it really is a superior OS for the average user. No virsus problems, malware, spyware or any of that shite. The OS will probably never need reinstalling as it doesn't go wrong but even if it did, it's a piece of piss to reinstall and all your settings, files and apps remain intact. There is every bit of software you could ever require and iLife contains some fantastic apps like iMovie.

products features as if it's never been done before despite having been available on other devices for a while.<br><br>However, I bought a macbook through my company as an exercise in learning about macs and what they are all about in case I ever need to work on them in the future and as much as it frustrates me not being able to do a number of what I consider to be pretty normal things without installing a 3rd party application, i can't deny that it is an awesome piece of kit in it's own right.<br><br>It doesn't get too hot, it's virtually silent, it never goes wrong, slows down or crashes, every gadget or peripheral I've ever plugged into it has worked without needing to install any software, it boots up really fast and connects to the wireless quicker than any of the high spec PC/laptops I have, the screen is excellent and the form factor is second to none.<br><br>I feel the same about the mac as i do the iphone, it's a fantastic user interface but frustrating if you want to do any more with it, knowing Lukes ability in the tech arena he will probably love the user experience, my only concern would be that it might have taken him 10 years to master the little intricacies of PC applications and shortcuts and whether he will get annoyed trying to get used to the different commands required on a mac to do those things as i don't think he has much stickability when it comes to working these things out.<br><br>Comparitively both my Nan and my Mum have been loving the new i series dell laptops I got for them for about £400 and they're probably on a par with Lukes ability with tech.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full"

frankly, the quality of the product from the keypad, screen, and case through to the operating system is better hands down. once you have had one for a while you will find all the apps you need, they're there, they're just not as well known as windows based stuff, what's not there are viruses, trojan horse spyware, malware etc. and it's not cause they're unpopular, that's been disproven with sales figures, it's because macs are designed with security that works and free updates rather than windows selling a product with more holes than a sieve requiring extra expenditure on antivirus and constant patches to keep it from giving the blue screen of death!<br>like everything, you get what you pay for i guess, i've been looking at a PC based laptop for tuning software that will only run on that format and i can get a dell for $250, i'd never log onto the net with it though, i'm way too tight to buy norton every week.<br><br>paul.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div

It's also nice not having to worry about viruses (real and fake), and because they are so controlling with third party software, everything works first time. You can even do right clicking with a right-click mouse.<br><br>However, they are overpriced, and over-controlling. Lots of stuff from other product manufacturers won't work at all, they dont like networking with anything else, and they try reformat all your hard drives just to say hello.<br><br>Conversly, PCs are cheap, flexible, clunky, but they do everything in the end, and easier to muck about with - so in terms of capability you get more bang for your buck, but just like it's easier to screw the fat ugly girl in your class, it's just not quite so much fun as working a little bit harder with the pretty one...<br><br>Ultimately, when it's my money, I tend to buy Apple...</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-02-28 20:20:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I liken this question to a similar question ones could ask in regards to why KTM<br>There is a value that is not quite as quantifiable as mpg.<br>It is smiles per minutes of use, and in my opinion, Apple creates a wonderful experience .<br>User friendly and cutting edge</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Duke4Dirk.svg" alt=Duke4Dirk> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Duke4Dirk</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-02 02:12:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>The Apple is for hippies... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n6mX8Q1waA</a></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-02 07:33:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>lol well I guess if you need a laptop that can be dragged behind a quad then that is the laptop for you.

My current laptop sit on the kitchen table and is always on and other than surfing the net, emails, music, spreadsheets and a bit of MS office it has no real memory intensive uses. <br>Im no computer geek but I can find my way around a PC no problems and fix most issues I have with it, so to re-learn it all at my advancing age I think is just too much for me to do (read cant be arsed). The only apple product I have is an ipod touch and its need to use proprietorial software irks me no end.<br>Now the same money spent on a PC will get me everything I want plus some, so in the end will definitely be the road I go down. Old habits and all that.</div></p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="about.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="terms.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
