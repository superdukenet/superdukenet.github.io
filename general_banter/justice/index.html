There were a couple of bikes waiting to exit and also being prevented by doing so because of passing traffic.As I waited for one final car to go past me on my right hand side, I was about to give a final check to see what was clear or not at the car park entrance and I was suddenly hit side on which sent me crashing to my left. I landed very hard on my left shoulder still astride my bike. Before I knew it I was standing upright and there were people standing around me and my bike, which someone had picked up for me. This tall guy comes around and apologises to me and says we should go to the car park and exchange details. I somehow manage to push my bike into the car park, (not knowing my collar bone had been smashed into 3 pieces with the centre portion pivoted 45 degrees ) and wait for him to come into the car park.<br>I waited for a few minutes and could see a couple of bikes parked up on the grass verge, then all of a sudden they rode off together, but Lucky enough I get the lead bikes number plate and also get a witness who also had got part of the plate.<br>To cut a long story short, the police paid a visit to this 2@ and he had to go to the station to give a statement. The police wanted to do him for "failing to stop after road accident and failing to exchange details" and "fail to report the accident" and "due care and attention".<br>I had to have a hooked plate put into my shoulder and was not allowed to drive for 7 weeks due to this asshole. I also had 4 and a half weeks off work and have had multiple trips to the hospital for xrays and phis yo and had to have my plate removed only 3 weeks ago due to the hook grinding a crater into my bone <br>Any how, I got a letter from my solicitor stating he admitted liability, and his insurer paid out for the repairs of my bike, (which were minor due to my shoulder taking the impact) yet he tells the police he was innocent <br>So I had to go to court on Friday and give my evidence. The prosecuting solicitor was as wet as a flannel and was useless in asking any questions, in fact it was embarrassing to watch, and I was not allowed to tell my complete story for some reason, and when I presented 2 pieces of paper which stated the accused was guilty due to him telling my solicitor that he was, and also a copy of the repair bill his insurers had paid for, the court was adjourned. Apparently I was not allowed to use this evidence due to "criminal justice" and "civil justice", I was absolutely fuming at such a stupid law. Your either guilty or not.<br>My witness took the stand and gave a story very similar to my own, and then the prosecuting solicitor read out the statement of the accused.<br>He said he took avoiding action and missed my bike, (which was bollox) and I had stalled my bike and fallen of my own accord <br>The defending solicitor said his client had stopped to see if I was alright and picked my bike up and that I had agreed I had just fallen off by myself, (again bollox).<br>After listening to the bollox that had been read out, they adjourned for lunch and my witnes and I went to a room with the prosecuting solicitor for a quick chat.<br>I was finally able to talk about the case to my witness who said he had picked my bike up and no one else, proving the accused was lying through his teeth I then had to leave to get home and prepare for work ,and I get a call from the wet flannel (prosecuting solicitor) telling me that the accused had a witness turn up who did not know him but had seen him around here and there, ( basically it was his feckin mate that was with him on his ride that day) and coincidentally happened to be in the car park that day and coincidentally followed him out of the car park and swore he did not connect with my bike <br>The judges then decided they could not prove he hit me or not, and he did stop and exchange details with me, (even though it was me who gave the police his reg plate and thus got a visit) but did say he drove without due care and attention <br>So the lying 2@ got a £350.00 fine and £300.00 court costs and some other small fine ? and I'm told his dick head solicitor would have cost him over £1000.00<br>plus he got 3 points on his licence. His insurers will have put his premium up because they paid out for the repairs to my bike and now he's got 3 points as well, so I look forward to them putting it up even more <br>If your in the Brighton area, then look out for a BMW R1200 in grey and ridden by a 2@ in his fifties, and the plate ends in DDA and he seems to be not only a poor rider but also a dishonest guy </div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=2bigalow" alt=2bigalow> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">2bigalow</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2012-11-18 20:32:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2012-11-18 20:32:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>that takes the piss . . . a grey bike FFS. . . . . </div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=MADDOG53" alt=MADDOG53> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">MADDOG53</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2012-11-19 04:27:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2012-11-19 04:27:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Karma's a bitch.

murdered someone you as a father would definitely be locked up perverting the course of Justice and receive a prison sentence, however when you interview Billy shit bag for a burglary which he flatly denies he was ever there, and then hit him with some DNA evidence in the future showing him at the scene, why do they never get done for perverting the course of justice????<br><br>I think I have only got one person to court with perverting the course of justice (usually drop it down to obstruct police) who made a false statement about her daughter, did she go to prison? no. Would you do to prison if you took 3 points for your wife and got found out? yes!<br><br>Billy shit bags always seem to win and thats what fooks me off about the English justice system.
