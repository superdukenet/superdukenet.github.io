We use laptops for work and his job requires him to transport his work laptop to/from various locations. On one trip, the laptop was stolen from his car and it may have contained valuable, proprietary data onboard. Upper management is steaming right now over the potential monetary risk and middle management blames my coworker for the loss, claiming that they were "unaware" he was transporting such data. There's no written policy about this particular matter and it was more of a verbal order from mid-management to lug the laptop back/forth. Mid-management seems to be using my coworker as a fall-guy to cover for their lack of written policy and to save their own asses.<br><br>Lessons to be learned perhaps being: don't trust anyone to fall on their sword if you can be thrown down instead, always ask for things in writing if it seems shady/risky, and don't do anything shady/risky to begin with....<br><br>(and really this isn't mine on the line, so feel free to speak ur mind)</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/dougle.svg" alt=dougle> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">dougle</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-30 22:40:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>hmm that really is the shitty end of the stick, I do the same with all of our clients data, the application Truecrypt is a free and handy thing to have installed<br><br>a sad fact is that he can prove he was following orders and a non-protocol but the working atmosphere is not going to be the same again, does he still want to work for these dickheads?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Duke4Dirk.svg" alt=Duke4Dirk> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Duke4Dirk</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-31 01:41:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Maybe this will help...<br><br><a class=postlink href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0_05Udm2U">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0_05Udm2U</a></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/easze76.svg" alt=easze76> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">easze76</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-31 02:44:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Sounds about right, its not that they are that cunning and want to use him as a scapegoat they just want to put their hands in the air and say we had no clue, which is why they are middle management, accountability is not their strong suit. According to my work policy we arent supposed to have any type of hardrive device at work, camera phones, ipods, laptops, SD cards, Blank CDs etc etc unless company issued. At the same time with what I do, we need to be multiple places during a project, and sometimes rarely at our desks for extended amounts of time, other areas or even off site. We need cellphones period, yet seems the powers above only can entrust middle management with these types of things, which then inturn forces our hand in carrying our own phones, we actually use them openly. The problem, we could at any time get called on this fact and basically canned on the spot. Quite a card to carry when you want to get rid of someone and dont need a real reason.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/PBRnr.svg" alt=PBRnr> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">PBRnr</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-31 06:00:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Echoing a lot of my thoughts here.
