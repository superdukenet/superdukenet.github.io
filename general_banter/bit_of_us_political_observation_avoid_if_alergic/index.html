Then there was an era of comfort, a president born in Kenya Hawaii who could massage the world with an understanding of what it meant to represent our cares and carress the people across distant shores with compassion and coherent cause. And then, seven and one half years later, all hell broke loose and I realised that all the years that I thought I had a finger on the pulse of the heartbeat of America, I came to the conclusion that I don't know diddlyshit what this landmass is all about. I too hear that the election is going to be close from many prognosticators.

Some how your country has to get corporates and the Tycoons (Trump) to pay their fair share in tax, and take the burden off middle americans. Trumps popular because middle Americans have had enough and are hurting. Bushes wars, and the debt thats created is his legacy. 2 terms under Obama wasn't enough to turn Bushes disasterous terms around.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=RichUK" alt=RichUK> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">RichUK</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2016-11-08 06:28:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2016-11-08 06:28:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>America has the same problem as Britain and the EU: it is not run by the people voted into office by the electorate. They are at best irrelevant and at worst a front for an antidemocratic, corporatist and internationalist clique of professional politicians and technocrats who view the general population with utter contempt and believe they and they alone have the moral compass and superior intelligence to run things; that voters are fools who need saving from themselves and that democracy just gets in the way and should be bypassed for the common good. It is a clique riddled with vested interest, self-serving corruption, megalomania and narcissism. It is why little ever seems to change or be achieved and why the policies voters thought they were electing their leaders upon are forever shelved as tomorrow's business while a programme they did not vote for or had even voted specifically against rolls on relentlessly today. <br>It why the British voted for Brexit and why the European project will collapse. It why far right and far left parties are on the rise across Europe and why Putin's Russia has become emboldened and increasingly bellicose and imperialist. He can smell decay.<br>Clinton is the apotheosis of this rotten order. She was born and raised to it. She knows no other world. Trump is an oaf and a dolt but he is also an outsider, a vulgar white-trash upstart who will never be welcomed into the closed world of the political elites. In that sense, even though with his billions he is as far away from the common man as the Ivy League Clinton, and despite his manifest unsuitability for high office, he is one of us. His is the proto protest-vote politician. If you asked a computer programme to produce a montage of an anti-politician, it would come up with the bizarre photo-fit image of Donald Trump. The real danger is not that he might win, but that he cannot because he is so preposterous and his doomed nomination will set back for a generation the task of lancing the boil modern politics and things will get far worse. When you need an Eisenhower, the best your system could produce was Trump.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=lc4" alt=lc4> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">lc4</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2016-11-08 07:20:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2016-11-08 07:20:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Very good summary there Gimlet. Totally agree. The worring thing about Trump is, he isn't doing the POTUS attempt for the good of Americans, no way, he's doing it for the power trip, there will be a lot of scared GOP members if he gets the reigns. He said he will reveal the real killers of Kennedy, he's said he will release Bushes involvement in 9/11, and the 28 pages that link the Saudi Royalties involvement and backing of the 19 Terrorists, and Bushes family links to the Saudi royal family. Your right about the corrupt sesspool that is American politics, and they hide behind religion, hence the hate for the Muslim religion. If Trump won with a landslide, i think he would be dead within 6 months before he could do too much damage to the 2 party (shared) political system you have.</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=DribbleDuke" alt=DribbleDuke> <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">DribbleDuke</h3> <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1 sm:mt-0"> <svg class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor> <path fill-rule=evenodd d="M5.75 2a.75.75 0 01.75.75V4h7V2.75a.75.75 0 011.5 0V4h.25A2.75 2.75 0 0118 6.75v8.5A2.75 2.75 0 0115.25 18H4.75A2.75 2.75 0 012 15.25v-8.5A2.75 2.75 0 014.75 4H5V2.75A.75.75 0 015.75 2zm-1 5.5c-.69 0-1.25.56-1.25 1.25v6.5c0 .69.56 1.25 1.25 1.25h10.5c.69 0 1.25-.56 1.25-1.25v-6.5c0-.69-.56-1.25-1.25-1.25H4.75z" clip-rule=evenodd /> </svg> <time datetime="2016-11-09 06:00:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500"> 2016-11-09 06:00:00 UTC </time> </div> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>Looks like the US may have a pussy grabbing, tax evading, orange skinned reality star with a possum on his head as a president....What a fuk up.</div> </div> </article> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2025 SuperDukeNet</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
