For those interested here are some findings.<br><br>Let me get this out of the way, the engine is awesome even though in this bike it feels restricted. If KTM lets it of the leash in the SD we have something to look forward too.<br>Now let me answer some questions:<br>Does it wheelie? <br>With the sport mode ON (full power) and the traction control ON it keeps the front about 10 cm above the deck on the throttle in 1-2 and 3rd gear. With TC OFF, HELL YES ) Once you hit something loose and slippery like deep sand or mud it will show you suddenly that it weights 230kg. The bike is capable but the standard tyres on the base model are not and will let you down. The R model with better off road tyres probably will fly over the same obstacles no problem.<br><br>Does it have the same plug under the seat as the SD? <br>Yes, but we need to find out if it actually works with tuneecu since it is fly by everything.<br><br>In general this is an awesome bike in every respect. It will never show its weight unless you do something stupid. The engine is smooth, powerful and economic, it pushes the bike forward with an urge normally reserved for sports bikes. Fuel consumption is not even comparable to the SD: to feed the 150 horses it can do 400km on a 23 l tank. No sign of surging throttle anywhere in any of the settings and it happily cruises at 140km/h all day. Gearbox could be a bit better but since the bike has 1500 km on it this can improve after running in some more. None of that super hot engine fan winding away as soon as you approach a stop light neither. I suppose since it’s and adventure bike they added a bigger radiator and improved cooling for getting trough slow sections while caked with mud.<br>Compared to the Adventure 990 and the SD it really shows what 10 years in development does. The engine, suspension and electronics are more refined and in general the bike is better engineered to be honest. On the other hand all this refinement takes a bit of excitement out of the ride too.<br>The windscreen is a bit weird, it helps but also buffeted my helmet a fair bit and I tried different settings. It is easy to adjust but you have to pull over to do so. Suspension is controlled electronically and adjust itself following the power settings you dial up on the LCD screen with easy accessible menu and push buttons on the left handle. Sport toughens up the suspension and allows full power, street is softer and restricted power, rain softer again with less grunt and off road the softest with smoothest power output. Suspension can also be adjusted for rider, rider plus gear, rider plus pillion, and rider plus pillion plus gear in another menu. I guess inside the menus all this can be tailored to taste again but I haven’t tried that. ABS and TC also change when using different modes to adapt to the demands for that mode. Some things can be switched off, like TC but needs access to other menus<br>Exhaust looks like it’s made by Akra but has no sound whatsoever and I can’t understand its design on this bike neither. It will totally ruin the possibility for storage on the right side pannier?! I’m sure there will be something aftermarket soon, to either make it sound like a V-twin or to fix the luggage problem. <br>Million dollar question, would I buy one? Deffo yes, it’s a great bike that will take you anywhere in comfort, at speed on the motorway and is capable off road. You want to be a dick and piss people off at the track, it will do that too.<br><br>Do I want to trade in the SD for this? Likely not... Will I have one as a second bike, yes please! (praying to the lotto god)<br><br>What sums it up for me is: do I want to travel somewhere I’ll take the Adventure, do I want to go for a ride I’ll take the SD!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8

</div> </div> <p><div class=content>Well done just about 600 miles on mine and I have to say its an awesome bike , once you've got your head round the 19" front wheel you can happily run on the edge of your tyres without trying , it doesn't turn in to quick (only negative I have about the bike) so you have to ride slightly different lines , however it induces smother lines at a slower pace than a modern sports bike , yet still extremely quick when you click with it , considering it only has 93 ft of torqueys it pulls like you wouldn't believe ,considerably faster than my 05 SD to my recollection<br>The bike is uber stable when you enter corners a bit too quick and need to brake and the balance is quite flattering. <br>Bike seems a lot more stable under power round fast bends than my old SD too<br>It does seem restricted too , as ktm guy pointed out , you know there's more power there.<br><br>Anyway I now need to find a way to get a new sdr too , would I consider chopping in the adv for a new sdr , .................quite possibly you do miss the short wheel base and 17" wheel<br><br>I forgot to mention the fueling....sublime for a KTM ,will potter round town at 20mph in 4th perfectly</div></p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex
