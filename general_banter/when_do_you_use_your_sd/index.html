I've used them every day more or less all year round, rain or shine, for commuting, weekend getting about, Sunday runs, touring, adventure and just generally hooning about on. Then as I've had kids I've also had a car for convenience and shopping and getting the family about but they've always been for practical uses - never a love affair. Had a few GTIs and fast cars but they were boring really.<br><br>Now, for the last 5 years I've had the SD and it's the best bike I ever had. Bar none. I've spent loads of time modifying it and riding it as much as I can and taking it on track days and Sunday ride outs and doing as much riding as I can. But as some of you know, new twin babies and a two year old and running a business have really had an impact on how much I can get out on it. But this isn't my frustration. This is.......<br><br>In the old days I would take every opportunity to ride. Going down the shops, picking up a newspaper, visit my mum, whatever. But also getting to work, going on business trips, visiting friends in distant cities for the night, going over the other side of London for a party, knowing I can't have a drink but worth it for the ride home without a cab fare. And I've stopped doing this because of the constant fear of having the bike nicked. This is a bad time we live in for bike theft, London is especially bad I think, and the recent theft of my mountain bike makes me even more paranoid about losing my pride and joy. I can fill a back pack with two Almax chains and carry a disc lock and alarm the bugger but still I come out of every trip away with a feeling of dread that the bike won't be there when I get to where I parked it. Bike thieves are too determined when they want it and have too many ways to overcome any deterrent you put in place.<br><br>So my habits have slowly changed over the years. I really only go out on the bike when I know that I will always be there with it. Track days are fine, obviously. Sunday runs are good because I'm always there - stop at the roadside - you with your bike. Stop at a cafe with mates - you sit and watch the bikes. Visit a bike shop - there's safety in numbers and parking outside a shop is OK. Visit a friend - make sure they have a garage or safe off road parking. Etc. Etc. But it has definitely changed the way I see biking and what I'm comfortable doing.<br><br>Was just thinking that I'd love to go to work on the bike tomorrow. But I can't leave the SD chained up in central London for 10 hours till I get out of work. It's just too long for a spotter for organised bike crime to clock it and have a pro team turn up and load it into a van. Doesn't matter that it's in a busy high street. Doesn't matter that there's thousands of people within touching distance of the bike - they would all look the other way. Last time I went to work I took a really old cover and put it over the bike to try and blend it into the background and disguise it. But when I got to the bike the cover had been removed and pushed under the bike. That got me really paranoid.<br><br>Anyway. Just thinking that this whole thing has me pissed off. I just want to ride whenever I can and not have to worry about all this shit.<br><br>I'm interested how many others have the same issue.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Linga.svg" alt=Linga> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Linga</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-08 22:08:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>That sounds totally horible mate!<br>Luckily I live in one of the more unpopulated cities in OZ.<br>The greatest thing we have to worry about is someone running it over or coming back to find some Bogan sitting on it.<br>I really feel for ya, Shit must be getting bad if your scared to leave your bike on the street.<br>I've never been your way, but am going next year, and I don't mind saying that I'm a little apprehensive...<br>It just seems to me that the denser a population gets, the greater effect the 2% of Morons have, they flock together.<br>I've got a Road/Trail that I smash around the streets every now and again on, and I'm paranoid about that, as two guys can just lift it into a Ute.<br>I wish insurance covered you for your actual bike instead of what they think it's "worth"</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/lobster.svg" alt=lobster> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">lobster</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-08 22:15:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>It is a real concern.

My first SD was nicked overnight outside my flat. It was tucked way out of site. Some thieving shits knew it was there and just lifted it off the front wheel, walked it up a long gardenpath and were away with it. Cos it was not locked in an outhouse as I said when insured it the insurance refused to pay a bean.It was only 6 months old.<br> I made the mistake of being honest and told em it was locked up but not garaged that one night. Strikes me the only way to catch these parasites is to fit a tracker. Can't see why we should but what otherway is there to feel you are likely to see your bike again?<br>Had an R1 nicked in 05 at Donington years ago whilst watching Rossi win in the pissing rain. Got backed to the car park. Bike gone. Turned out some little 17 year old scrote put my bike along with 5 others in the back of his transit and just drove out of the circuit! <br>Found by the police 3 days later by chance when someone tipped em off some dodgy guy had a load of bikes in a lock up. <br>Every time I go to a circuit ever since I feel its just by luck I find my bike where I left it.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-08 22:46:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hey Lobster. <br><br>Just sold my house in London, a few days to exchange and maybe a few weeks to completion.

Although I can't chain it to something I park it out of general view. There are a couple of drivers who like the SD and ride into work themselves, and would know if somene was sniffing about. There's usually a cop car parked within a few metres of it, which helps too. But, yes, I'm paranoid after having two bikes nicked in one year and won't leave the SD in plain sight.

Where abouts are you?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/StupidLuke.svg" alt="Stupid Luke"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Stupid Luke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-09 20:30:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Geez..Sounds bad out there Bic..<br>I'd of never thought..<br>I'm here in So.Cal and I've had cars stolen..Never my bikes..I've kept 'em too locked down mostly..<br>I ride back n forth to work but it's only 6 miles..At least since I got the Superduke..<br>Was different when I had my Harley...I keep my KTM at work mostly..And lately since I'm always takin it back apart to do mods..I haven't riden a lot..Getn there..<br>I know one thing..I'm enjoying myself..!!!!!<br>Cheers<br>Mike</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MADDOG53.svg" alt=MADDOG53> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">MADDOG53</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-09 21:00:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/stalker.svg" alt=stalker> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">stalker</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-09 22:10:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Always thought that London was a place on the "to visit list",,,,,you get very phylisophical when you smoke that stuff Bic,,,,,,,could be you "should" become a writer,,,,,,,,out in the country writing about the crummy city,,,,farm life wouldn't be bad at all,,,time to write,,ride,,and spend time with the family </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/StupidLuke.svg" alt="Stupid Luke"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Stupid Luke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-11-10 04:12:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content> I'd have stayed there permanently if I could've.
