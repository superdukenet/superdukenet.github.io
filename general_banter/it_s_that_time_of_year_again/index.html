One of the (few) nice things about Kansas is that there is none of that. The extent of inspection when I first registered the bike after purchase was to verify VIN and year matched the paperwork. The tech at my local dealer runs a 94 CBR900 rat bike with an open header. <br><br>Of course I've also lived where this kind of thing was a major hassle. Once had the reverse light switch in my 97 Nissan truck short out, which caused a fault that made it fail the yearly emissions inspection (check engine light is on,you fail).

Another bad experience. Dropped bike off yesterday to get MOT. Needed horn sorting. They rang in the afternoon saying that horn was sorted but that the back light was flashing when they tried the indicators. This was a bit strange because I'd disconnected the leads which operated the integrated flashers to the unit. I agreed they should take a look and get it through the MOT.<br><br>Today they ring me and say that they've fixed the back light but that the indicators don't work. <br><br>"Can we fit some new ones?"<br><br>I say, "No - because the indicators are Rizoma Zero units and they have worked for eight years without a problem and they actually worked yesterday didn't they?" <br><br>They say, "Well they don't work now".<br><br>"Because you've broken them then - they worked yesterday".<br><br>So I go round to get my bike. So they fail the MOT and want to charge me for three hours work on top of the MOT bill. I have a bit of a talk with the manager (!!) and end up resentfully agreeing to pay for one hour for the time spent fixing the horn (£50 plus VAT). <br><br>I take my bike round to my garage and look at what they've done. They've chopped off half the socket connectors I carefully installed eight years ago and replaced them with bullet connectors, two of which pulled off in my hands when I removed the seat. They've removed the alarm unit in the tail and reinstalled it wonky with one of the screws missing. They've cut the Rizoma leads short (why?) when putting on the bullet connectors so they are too tight and can't route properly. <br><br>And yes, they've managed to somehow damage one of the Rizoma units so it doesn't work anymore. I've tracked it down to the actual unit so somehow the LED inside is broken and they are sealed units. They say it was a coincidence that it must have just broken at the same time as them doing all this work. They say it wasn't them - even though when put on the spot they accept that both rear units were working yesterday otherwise that's what it would have failed the MOT on in the first place, not the rear light issue.<br><br>And to cap it all. Bu the time I'd spent two hours going through all the wiring and identifying all the problems and re attaching new bullet connectors when I tried to start the bike I had a flat battery! Haven't got any power at my lock-up so I had to push the bike home 2.5 miles!!!!!!! I was absolutely knackered. Took an hour and a half with a LOT of breaks. I'm getting too old for this. ha ha.<br><br>So I have no MOT, therefor no legal tax, a broken Rizoma and a flat battery (now finally on charge)<br><br>What a shit day.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2017-02-03 16:49:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>That does sound like a shit day!<br><br>Just in case you didn't know, a cheap clip on bicycle horn counts for MOT purposes (clip on, MOT, Remove) Less than £5<br><br>I may have some old std indicators in the garage somewhere if you want them.
