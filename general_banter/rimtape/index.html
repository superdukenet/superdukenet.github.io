I deserve it but…….<br><br>Do 1290 owners do any mods to their bikes at all except put on rim tape decals?<br><br>When are you lot going to start modding the bike in the way people really mod bikes after six months of ownership? What are there mechanical things you've worked out need sorting? What are the engine mods that unleash more power that the factory had to hide due to emissions regs? What happens when you remove the air box? What happens when you start tinkering with the electronics? What happens when you start changing the steering geometry or swapping out the suspension for something else?<br><br>Oh, I forgot. The new KTM 1290 is a bike that has too much electronic trickery for any mere mortal to tinker with. I empathise, I wouldn't know where to begin with this. <br><br>The engine is basically a sealed unit and no one dare go inside it for fear of invalidating the warranty. I'd feel the same guys.<br><br>All the shit manufacturing issues to do with leaking oil is not something you can just fix. It is just badly made.<br><br>The rear wheel bearing? What can I say? I think it's all been said.<br><br>The bad finish on cast components? It's not something you can really fix is it? Just get to live with.<br><br>The badly made stuff like mirror stems braking etc. Well get some other mirrors, job done.<br><br>Which leaves you all with nothing to do except……..<br><br>Communicate endlessly which exhaust you are all going to buy. Answer: Any that does away with the shit emissions Euro regulated crap that was OE. Just pay a lot off cash and take your pick. Very few of you will be able to feel the actual performance enhancement. Christ the standard OE silenced engine makes far more than I could ever really cope with anyway.<br><br>Discuss and show off your generic and obvious wheel colour customisation, (orange and white with "ready to race" copy).<br><br>And for all you others that don't know how to remove thew wheels.<br><br>Rim tape.<br><br>It always seems to come down to rim tape.<br><br>All this makes me want to slash my wrists. Sorry but if this is what biking and forum debates about ownership have come down to then I just need to vent.<br><br>There are some exceptions to the rule in SD1290 ownership on this forum. You know who you are.

But what have you done to contribute. And by the way this thread is pretty boring as well. I think it time to go riding . I got my bike just the way I like it right now. Don't feel the need to mode it at this point any further than it is. It's doing every thing right. It handle beautifully. The motor for agressive street riding is perfect compared to my old 08 SDR 990. I'm afraid at this point if I mode it it will loose the near perfect balance. <br><br>Btw I don't like rim tape. If I'm going to bolt anything to my bike it's going to have to add performance. I may try one of the air box modes and power commander and fook with the tuning in the future. But right now I'm satisfied. <br><br>Edit: Oh yea I'm a street rider only. But like to go fast in the turns. And use all the performance the bike has( I twist the throttle wide open). I'm sure I'm not in your league though. <br><br>Current bolt on modes:<br><br>Ergo sport seat.<br>Hooligan pegs.<br>Suspension: New front springs.

Got a PCV to go on with quick shifter and hoping to get a Rootveiler Airbox ASAP. Best bike I've every owned and loving it. I'm guessing I'm about the same age as you Bic and have grown up with Yamaha two strokes and Kawasaki triples. Lately I've had a succession of SDs (20005,2009 and 2008 SDR). The great think about the new SDR is the engine is such a peach. I've had virtually nothing go wrong in the year I've owned it. I don't really understand the overt resentment you (Bic) have shown to the new bike. I loved my old SDs but Lord knows plenty went wrong with them. If you don't like the new bike that's fine, it does actually mean it's dreadful it's just not for you. Personally it's the best fun I've ever had with any bike. I've used it a reasonable amount and it just gets better.
