I quickly spotted a biker on the opposite side of the road who had lane-split to be at the limit line. I see lots of riders during the day as I travel the peninsula and usually don't think twice but what I noticed about this bike was that he had no headlight on. I also could see from the general silhouette of the bike it was a naked sportbike of some kind. Initially I was thinking, gee I wouldn't want to ride around here without a working headlight what with all the distracted urban drivers... As the light turned green, the emerging side profile of the bike became more apparent: big ass rear cog, beefed up frame sliders, no headlight to speak of...it's a stunt machine. Sure enough, the rider hops two feet on the saddle and pulls a big 12 o'clock wheelie down the road as I continue on my merry way through the clumps of distracted drivers all the way back home.<br><br>As I drove, I guess I was equally guilty of driving somewhat distracted by my thoughts on that rider and my own personal views on "responsible" moto riding. For starters, coming back home in one piece with a bike that looks the same as I took out of the garage is a priority. When I still had my SD, I admit I'd justify some "spirited" riding and a little loftiness of the front wheel (if you saw my wheelie class vid, I can't pull one off longer than 200ft or higher than 2.5 ft ) but only in the absence of traffic/people. Otherwise, my riding ethic was use the bike within my ability to survive to ride again. The only times I've had costly encounters with LEOs were from times of poorer judgement and letting "fun" get the better of me. Now that my only ride is my tractoring '83 BMW R100RS, the amount of sheer effort it would take for me to approach anything resembling hooliganism has me choosing to ride sedately before I even turn the ignition on.<br><br>I got to thinking about how susceptible I was to riding a machine differently depending on a number of factors. Is it the bike's inherent abilities/setup? Is it my personality? Is it the stereotype of the bikes image? I do believe I rode the SD "harder" on the street because TBH it was a more "capable" machine at doing just that than my RS. As such, I was much more confident (or foolishly overconfident) riding the SD the way I did over the RS now. I've been told a squid, is a squid, is a squid no matter what machine they ride. Maybe I was just a closet squid on the SD and a now restrained poser on my RS.<br><br>I do think if I owned a bike purpose-built to stunt, as that rider's clearly was, I'd just be totally stressed about riding it around the street like the expectation to stunt it is too much to get away from. Between being on a badly geared bike for general riding and drawing the negative attention of probably every LEO within a 500ft radius, I feel I'd be miserable. Even if my sole existence was to pull massive wheelies all day long wherever the hell I pleased, the inevitable fix-it tickets and impending loss of license would be a major buzz kill.<br><br>I guess the point of my rant is that I loved the SD for being a closet-hooligan's bike. It could be ridden sedately and just look fast while your at the stoplight or rolling at 25mph...it could also cause you to lose your license (or more, knock on wood) with a little more right hand.<br><br>So I wonder, does anybody else here ride differently depending on the bike being used? Why or why not?</div> </div> </article> <article class="border rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 bg-white"> <header class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4"> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14" src="https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/identicon/svg?seed=DribbleDuke" alt=DribbleDuke> <div class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-between"> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">DribbleDuke</h3> <time datetime="2017-06-24 15:56:00 UTC" class="text-sm text-gray-500">2017-06-24 15:56:00 UTC</time> </div> </header> <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800"> <div class=content>For years I had motorcycles that asked too much out of you to ride fast and stop fast, or should I say ride quick and stop quick. I would push these bikes to their limits wishing the front end would just please come up or that the back end would please break loose to steer it through the final part of a bend. I have had multiple dual sport bikes that hooligan to a certain extent, mainly in the fact that they feel like a cardboard cutout of a real street bike and with knobbies they get to roll around themselves at good cornering pace. I am a firm believer that it is not the bike that determines your destiny but more the bikes deficiencies I bought a FJR1300 in 03 that was a whale of a time. It was a ridiculously heavy hooligan it would wheelie on purpose but it cornered like a 68 cadillac. I traded it in for a v-strom and a Duke II and ended up with two scrappy toys that functioned quite similar. I was finally home. I said to myself that no matter how many bikes come and go through my greasy hands, I will always have one that will wheelie up in second gear at a twist in a moments notice. My ratio of accomplishment of the promise is 3/5. In that i would conclude that I may just be 3/5 hooligan heading everyday to 1/5 cause I can ride a bike all day and leave the front end down. But please don't take my ability away. I think you have a Duke in your future.<br>I mounted one of those tyres I scored from you with my new No-Mar tyre changer.

I've also had 37 other bikes, ranging from RS250 Aprilia's to 1000cc sports bikes and a few Aprilia Tuonos. Currently have an MV Agusta F4 keeping the SDR company.<br><br>The first SDR I wheelied into oblivion, going over backwards at 120 kmh when my ambition very much outweighed my ability. That scarred me physically and mentally. I still wheelie, but the days of sitting on the back wheel through the gears are long gone.
